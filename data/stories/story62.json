Filed between the pages are strips of newspaper. You pull one out. It\u2019s a very faded line of \u201chelp offered\u201d ads. You read a few which a circled. \u201cEducation student seeks part-time nanny position\u201d \u201cWe will walk your dog! Call Jane and Katie.\u201d\nYou pull out another strip. It is personal ads. There are three circled. \u201cSWF, 24, pretty n\u2019 plump, seeks soul mate\u201d \u201cSBF, 22, loves red wine and Scrabble\u201d \u201cSWF, 19, N/S, N/D. I love everything. Let\u2019s meet!\u201d You pull out yet another cutting. This is newer. Your eyes scan down, and you recognize the ad that you and Sophie placed. It is circled in magic marker. Sophie, who has been reading along, says \u201cWhat do these mean?\u201d\n\nYou stand up. \u201cWell, either there\u2019s a lonely guy, who wants a nanny and dog walker, livign here, or something really wrong is going on. I think we sh - \u201c\n\nYou stop and whirl around as you hear the door groaning softly. Through the dusty light of the room, you see a tall, well groomed man with black hair. He is smiling at you, his brows knit, and inquiry on his lips.\n\nSophie stands up hurriedly. \u201cExcuse me - I\u2019m sorry, but we really need to be going and\u2026\u201d\n\nHe approaches, a comforting smile on his face. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry,\u201d he says warmly. \u201cI think you might have run into my wife in the kitchen.\u201d You and Sophie look at each other, remembering the knife-wielding maniac. He continues. \u201cShe\u2019s been ill lately. I\u2019m sorry she turned on you with the knife. You surprised her while she was cooking. She\u2019s gone back to bed. I promise you she won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d He smiles again, his white teeth sparkling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we haven\u2019t been introduced. I\u2019m Mr. Alexander, the owner of the house. You\u2019re Sophie and Alex, right? Pleased to meet you. Let\u2019s just get you the list of tasks ans you can get started.\u201d\n\nYou bite your lip. His story is kind of plausible, but you\u2019re still troubled.\n\nWhat do you do?", "action_results": [{"action": "Run!", "result": "You see that he left the living room door open. You grab Sophie\u2019s wrist and you run for the door.

But you\u2019ll wish you cooperated\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly he makes a choking noise and lets you go. You make no hesitation, and you dart out the door.\n\nAs you and Sophie hurdle through the sitting room and up the staircase, you ask her, \u201cWhat just happened? Why did he let us go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI kicked him in the nuts,\u201d Sophie replies.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d you say. The two of you look for a hiding place upstairs. You see a room that looks like a children\u2019s playroom, so you hurry in there seeking shelter.\n\nYou decide to hide behind a large bookshelf. But as you are climbing behind it, you bump into the wall. To your surprise, the paneling opens inward into a dark, foul smelling room.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Sophie asks you.\n\n\u201cSomething else weird, I suppose\u2026\u201d you choke, gagging on the smell coming from the room.\n\nJust then, a small voice floats out of the darkness. \u201chello?\u201d\n\nWhat do you do?", "action_results": [null]}]}]}]}, {"action": "\"No, we need this money.
