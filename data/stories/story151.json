It's not enough that it's pitch black out--of course your vision's gone blurry too, and the smell of cigarettes from the rooftop is making your head pound even more. God, the inside of your skull feels like wet smoke. \n\n\nFinally, the door unlocks, but your friend from high school is standing in the doorframe as it creaks aside. Well, not exactly friend. More like friend-of-a-friend, acquaintance kind of guy. Could you fit any more kids into a crappy shore house? You hardly know half the group with sleeping bags in your room. \n\n\n\"Thanks,\" you mumble, looking down as to avoid eye contact. \n\n\nHe doesn't move out of the threshold. \"You've been jangling your keys and cursing for ten minutes,\" he says flatly. \n\n\n\"Yeah, sorry about that. Remind me to never drink again,\" you trail off, pushing past the dirty t-shirt and boxers. He gives you a sour look, then trudges back to whatever room he was sleeping in. \n\n\n\"Piss off,\" you whisper. God, could he be any more patronizing? You practically hurl yourself onto the nearest couch in the living room, dropping the shoes and wallet you already had hanging from your hand as you walked home. Yeah, laying down is much better. But would this headache ever stop? \n\n\nDespite that, you feel yourself slowly drifting off, the sounds of passing cars, crashing waves, and barking dogs getting softer and softer by the second. \n\n\nAnd you close your eyes. \n\n\n ", "action_results": [{"action": "Wake up?", "result": "Deep in sleep, you're interrupted by someone's alarm.

You didn't notice it before, but you're panting and your heart's racing. Calm down, you begin to tell yourself, it's just a dream.
