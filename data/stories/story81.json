I like the dark, and I have the M\u00f6rker for company. He sits up in my head and watches. Sometimes he talks to me, tells me what to do. I do what he says, because otherwise he will punish me. I remember when I first met the M\u00f6rker. I was scared of him then, but now I am terrified. The M\u00f6rker tells me to do things that I\u2019m not supposed to. You aren\u2019t allowed to kill people, but he M\u00f6rker told me to, so I did. I killed lots of people. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, in the darkness. To make me stop. But you can\u2019t stop the M\u00f6rker. \n\n\nThe days pass, like they always do, sitting in the darkness with the him. We plan together, deciding what to do when we get out. I know we will, eventually. But in the meantime, the darkness is welcoming. It gives the M\u00f6rker and I time to think. Time to plan who will die first. The M\u00f6rker is very angry with the ones who put us here. But there is something deeper than just anger and resentment. There is pure hatred hiding within the M\u00f6rker, and I know he has a reason. I just need to know what it is.

I just want to know what the secret is. \n\n\nI know that if I let him take control, I will be reduced to nothing. My soul will be pushed to the far corner of myself, and it will be locked away. All of my thoughts, memories, feelings, affections, grudges, gone. All traces of what I was before will be destroyed, lost forever. I'm forgetting most of that stuff anyway.

I have finally proved that I am not just a doll on a string, that I have a free will. I know the secret that he was hiding from me. I wish though, that I didn't know. The M\u00f6rker was trying to protect me, trying to sheild me from the real horrors of the world. He was trying to keep me from knowing how privileged I am compared to so many others, others that I have killed. They do not get the sweet bliss that comes with total acceptance of him.

I continue to batter the M\u00f6rker with endless assaults, slamming into him over and over again until his presence fades. As my head clears for the first time in decades, the darkness around me fades slightly. I can see, but barely. I glance down at my chest. Thick, oily black liquid oozes down my shirt, leaving behind a trail of tiny droplets caught on the fabric. I watch it, intrigued, and run my hand under the flow playfully. The liquid runs down my fingers, dripping softly onto the floor. Out and out it pours, soaking my feet and legs with slimy darkness.

One of the guards, apparently a leader, steps forward into the room, only to back out hurriedly, choking. \n\n\n\"Somebody call the fucking cops!\" he shouted at the unruly mob.\n\n\nAs the guards slowly dispersed, the interior of the room slowly became visible. Slumped over her metal cot was a young girl, perhaps around the age of 16 or 17. Her hair was dark, falling down her back in a cascade of tangles and knots. Her hand hung down from the bed, lightly skimming the floor. Her face wasn't visible, obscured by her thick hair. This would have been a relitively normal scene, bar the fact that the girl was dead. In the very center of her chest, she had torn into her flesh so deeply that the bones of her ribcage could be seen clearly. Her fingers were soaked in blood, and her fingernails were covered in the flesh she ripped apart. She had bled so profusely that the floor was now barely visible, and images of blood gushing from this poor girl's chest flashed through the unfortunate guard's mind. Here and there, chunks of skin and flesh poked up through the pool of blood, somehow scattered all the way to the other side of the room. \n\n\nAs police investigators arrived at the scene, it was immediately agreed upon that this had been a suicide.\n\n\n\"Such a shame.\" offered the deputy officer. \"We tried our hardest, but this one never seemed to even notice us. Wrapped up in her own little world, she was.\"\n\n\n\"Well I frankly don't give a shit why she died. I just need you to fill out the paperwork.\" a nearby policeman grunted.\n\n\n\"Oh, come on. You really think anyone will notice she was gone? Let's just get the team to clean up, dispose of the body, and be done with it. I gotta be home early tonight, I got no time for this shit.\"\n\n\nA general murmur of agreement was heard from the surrounding officers.\n\n\n\"Very well then.\" huffed the policeman. \"Nice to see you, Officer. You really need to swing round for coffee sometime, we haven't had a good chat in ages.\"\n\n\nAs the clean up team slowly began scrubbing at the floor, the deputy officer walked away slowly, his shadow growing darker with every step.

My head spins crazily as I attempt to stand, and I collapse back on the bed heavily.\n\n\nWhen I wake up I can hear activity behind my door, which frightens me. I thought I was alone here, trapped with the M\u00f6rker. Come to think of it, where is he? I call out to him gently, but to no avail. I poke and prod the space in my head where he is supposed to be, but I feel nothing. I start panicking, without him, I am nothing! I start screaming frantically, thrashing wildly. Where is he, where is he? My chest is heaving, my eyes roll back in my head. What have I done? My hands go to my chest, where I forced the M\u00f6rker out. My breath comes in gasps and sobs, it's hard to see straight. My fingers curl around the edges of the gash that he came out of, and I consider just ripping myself in two. Am I strong enough? Would it work? Only one way to find out.\n\n\nJust as I prepare to tear open my skin, now slippery with blood, my door flies open. There is a person there, looking at me wildly. He rushes over and tries to take my hands. I snatch them away, screaming at him. What is going on? Who is this? As he moves closer to me, light from the door streams into the room and lands on my bloodstained fingers. I stop abruptly, staring at my hands. I had almost forgotten what light was. The man takes advantage of my stupor to grab my head in his hands, and he holds my chin up so that I am looking him in the eye. Maybe this person is the M\u00f6rker? Maybe he's come back for me?

He nods his head slowly, and I feel his power coursing through my veins. I can do anything I want. I am invincible as long as he is with me.\n\n\nI stand up, holding my head high.
