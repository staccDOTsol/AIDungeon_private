You\u2019re not a fan, to say the least, of visiting the old cottage filled with just-as-old people. Ok, that\u2019s mean. Deep down, you love your grandma and grandpa, but seeing them is never like in the movies. Grandma doesn\u2019t bake cookies all day and slip you 20 dollar bills while your parents aren\u2019t looking. Grandpa doesn\u2019t sit in a recliner, playing a game of am I asleep or dead?! No, it\u2019s never like that.\n\nThe old cottage is far off from any neighbors, deep in the jungle-like Appalachian rainforest. The northbound highway cuts into a smaller state road, single lane, that leads into the heart of the forest. It\u2019s a sudden shift, entering into the forest. Clear, open air is replaced with a constant layer of gray mist, hanging heavy, not unlike bathroom air after a steamy shower. A single lane invites you in, coaxingly, comfortingly. A single road leads out.\n\nYou sit in the backseat of your parent\u2019s RAV 4, headphones in, doing your best to ignore the unfortunate circumstance you found yourself in. To your left, behind the driver\u2019s seat, sits Emma, your little sister. Ha! She couldn\u2019t get out of it either. Being the favorite doesn\u2019t come with unlimited power, although at times it seems that way.\n\nShe\u2019s tuned into an intense episode of New Girl on her iPad, eyes glued on the screen, child-like demeanor becoming more \u201cteen\u201d by the day, another word for rebellious. Your parents \u201clove you both equally,\u201d yet somehow that statement doesn\u2019t seem to be true. Give it a couple of years, and see how much they favor their baby girl when she's a full-blown teen. You imagine you\u2019ll come across as goddamn presidential when that happens. You know, like the stories of past US presidents as kids; they\u2019re always so well-behaved, so perfect, little rule-followers unmarked by scandalous behavior.", "action_results": [{"action": "Arrive", "result": "After a safe, gradual pump of the brakes, your father turns the RAV 4 down a gravel driveway. Calling it a driveway is an understatement. The gravel road runs for several hundred feet, and your father takes care to avoid all the potholes lining the way like uncovered landmines. Each small dip into one of the holes, sends your parent\u2019s heads swaying side-to-side. You move your head from its resting position against the window after one nasty dip results in a minor bump (and laugh from Emma) to your temple.\n\nUntrimmed trees, in desperate need of a good haircut, hang over the driveway, creating a small tunnel and blocking a good amount of sunlight, not that there\u2019s a good amount of sunlight to be blocked. Rain continues to drizzle. The RAV 4 keeps a steady rhythm with its wiper blades. Finally, after a sharp turn, the cottage appears in the distance.\n\nSmall and unassuming it sits, resting nicely between two large trees. From this distance, the trunks rise high like football goalposts. Single story, single garage, the beige house is quiet. Its weathered lavender trim is becoming more gray, blending in with the primary house paint. The living room window is split down the center with a large crossbeam, creating a pair of eyes, illuminated with soft yellow light, watching your arrival. It doesn\u2019t say a word as your father sends the RAV 4 into parked position.\n\n\u201cNow be respectful to your grandparents,\u201d your father lectures as you unbuckle your seatbelt. \u201cHelp me unload.\u201d\n\nYou watch your sister and mother head towards the front door, each head still buried in their book and iPad.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they help?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s proper for a man to do the lifting,\u201d your father answers. \u201cThat\u2019s why God gave you these,\u201d he adds, squeezing your arm.\n\n\u201cSure thing, Dad.\u201d You roll your eyes in good fun, not unaccustomed to your father\u2019s stereotypical humor.", "action_results": [{"action": "Unload", "result": "You grab an ice chest from the trunk of the RAV 4 and head towards the front door, which has been conveniently closed by your sister, even though she\u2019s probably well aware you needed it ajar. You set down the chest and reach for the knob. Before your hand touches the metallic knob, the door swings open and you find yourself staring face to face with wrinkled skin and that smell which accompanies anyone over the age of 65. Your grandma, dressed in a gown that would be considered outdated decades ago, reaches over the chest to wrap you in a loose hug.\n\nAwkwardly, you return the favor, having to lean over the parked ice chest and sending your hips back for a counterweight. Warm skin presses against the side of your cheek, closely followed by a wet kiss. Respectfully, you don\u2019t wipe it just yet. It sits there on your cheek like a domesticating brand, one that allures to desmaculation and neuterization. Behind Grandma, Emma gives you a devilish grin, well-aware of the fact you\u2019re not a fan of sloppy wet kisses from old people.\n\n\u201cHi Grandma. Good to see you,\u201d you say, respectfully.\n\n\u201cGood to see you too, dear. Oh leave that for your father,\u201d she says looking at the ice chest. \u201cHe\u2019s looking a bit thin. You already have a lot of muscle built up,\u201d she adds, touching your arm. It\u2019s not hard to see which side of the family she\u2019s from.\n\nYou follow her inside to the kitchen and plop yourself down at the dinner table. Aged wallpaper surrounds outdated appliances and furniture like a picture-perfect antique store. Small designs of green and red stripes line the base of the wallpaper. God knows why the designer did that.\n\n\u201cHoney, why don\u2019t you greet your grandpa? Grandma says he\u2019s out back,\u201d your mom says from the head of the table, face still buried in Nicholas Sparks Land.", "action_results": [{"action": "Yes", "result": "The back door could use some work. It takes a couple of pulls before the thing actually swings open. It\u2019s probably a struggle for Grandma to even open the damn door. Of course that\u2019s assuming she actually leaves the house. Something tells you she mostly stays within the kitchen and living room. The small treadmill placed in the corner of the living room provides good proof to that fact. Outside, you\u2019re greeted with gray sky above an evergreen backdrop.\n\nGrass, long neglected, rises waist-high burying unkempt bushes under its overgrowth. A single path leads towards the shed, which has more in common with a garage than a shed. It\u2019s the size of a two-car, its sides long lost their red paint, leaving behind a barely visible red streak covering its panes of wood. A soft glow from an overhead light, like the ones mechanics use, shines through a crevice left by the cracked-open door. Walking briskly to avoid raindrops, not that you succeed, you arrive at the shed door and peer inside.\n\nOpposite of the door, a backdrop of tools hang on the wall. It looks like a cork board, but instead of posters listing Roommate wanted! No animals allowed! it simply holds aged hammers and different sizes of screwdrivers. You hear scratching inside; whatever Grandpa is doing, it sounds like a file rubbing against rusted metal.\n\n\u201cGrandpa?\u201d you speak into the cracked door.\n\nNothing.\n\nYou slide the door open a few inches further and scoot inside like the upright version of a high jumper, narrowly hitting a pole. You\u2019re hit with a wave of dust, causing an instant sneeze. As sneezes often come in pairs, you patiently wait for the second one. After it passes, you wipe your nose on your sleeve and continue the search. An aged Challenger takes up most of the shed\u2019s inside, losing most of its original yellow paint. Hard top, a 1973 Rallye, you\u2019d find out later.\n\nThe scratching grows louder, and you feel the hair on the back of your neck rise. Suddenly, you have a great urge not to be in your grandfather\u2019s shed. Steady raindrops patter on the shed\u2019s roof. Behind you, water drip, drip, drips: a result of cracks in the shed\u2019s roof.\n\nErrrrch!\n\nThe scratching grows into a longer, slower resonation.\n\nErrrrrrrrch!\n\nStill, it draws out in length. That does it. Time to return back to the cottage. You whip around, ready to leave the place and run smack into the wall. No, not the wall. Grandpa. His flannel, likely made decades ago, is rolled up at the sleeves exposing a lifetime of forearm muscle built from working with his hands. Like a weight is placed on one shoulder, his torso leans slightly to the left, his right shoulder resting an inch higher than the other. His face is mostly covered in shadow, save for the point of his nose, from the trucker hat pulled low on his head.\n\n\u201cLeave, boy.\u201d\n\nHis voice is firm, cracked near the edges, not from ill-intent -- likely the cause of living through years of regular smoking. There\u2019s a solid amount of force behind the voice; it\u2019s not some labored breath slinking from an elderly man\u2019s throat. It\u2019s intentional, and it means business.\n\nWithout a word, you take off running. Outside, you sneak a glance back, still moving quickly. Through the crack in the shed door, you see Grandpa staring at you, only enough room for one eye to peer through the slot. The door shuts completely.", "action_results": [{"action": "Dinner", "result": "A little while later, you\u2019re back at the dinner table surrounded by your immediate family and Grandma.

And there\u2019s the fact he definitely didn\u2019t want you poking around there. Fine. Keep your precious outhouse. I\u2019ll reside in the main house, mastuh! According to Grandma, that\u2019s where he spends all of his time.\n\nIronically, Grandpa arrives shortly after the words leave her mouth. His trucker hat is no longer pulled down low; it rests normally on his head like how an ol\u2019 vet would wear one. He sits down at the head of the table, right next to you.\n\n\u201cNice of you to join us, Dear,\u201d Grandma speaks, passing a bowl of lightly-toasted rolls.\n\n\u201cHad some business to take care of. How\u2019re doing, kiddos?\u201d Grandpa answers, taking the bowl of rolls, and flashing a toothy smile, one that displays surprisingly good dental work for someone his age. Either that, or they\u2019re dentures. Your guess is the latter.\n\nA moment of silence passes before your mother commands, face un-buried in her novel this time. \u201cWell? Answer him?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d you and Emma say, simultaneously, not really sure what else to say.\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d Grandpa answers, taking his knife to a piece of chicken. For the remainder of the dinner, you do your best to input little yes\u2019 and no\u2019s when the circumstance arrives, but honestly, what\u2019s more boring than dinner at your grandparent\u2019s house? You\u2019ve heard the same stories about your dad several times now, and you can only smile, nod, and act surprised so many times.

Unsurprisingly, Emma leaves to keep her iPad company in the guest room, one that you\u2019re sharing. Surprisingly, your parents don\u2019t stick around either. They follow Grandma into the living room (to take another peek at the \u201cfine\u201d china?), leaving you alone with Gramps at the table.\n\nYou both sit, silent, staring straight ahead before you take the initiative. \u201cAre you fixing up that car in the back?\u201d\n\nGrandpa answers. \u201cThe \u201873 Rallye? Once upon a time I was. Parts are hard to come by now. She still runs, though. Less beautiful as before.\u201d\n\nSilence returns, to no fault of your own. Typically the way these things go is the older one speaks and you nod and listen.\n\n\u201cDo you have your license yet?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cJust a permit. Dad says I\u2019ll need to find a job to pay for gas.\u201d\n\n\u201cA man needs to work,\u201d Grandpa says. \u201cWhen I was your age, I was working full days at the factory, only taking breaks to attend classes at school.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a story you\u2019ve heard before. You\u2019ve heard a similar one told by your father, about walking 10 miles in the pouring rain to school, and then walking 10 miles home just to strap on an apron and bag groceries at the local supermarket. You wonder how much of that is true. Maybe it felt like 10 miles to an adolescent kid.\n\n\u201cListen, kiddo,\u201d Grandpa speaks again, lowering his voice so the others in the living room won\u2019t overhear. The fun, smile-flashing old man is gone, replaced with the one you ran into earlier. \u201cStay away from the shed. There are...dangerous tools in there. I wouldn't want you to get hurt.\nYou nod. \"I saw them hanging on the wall, but I didn't touch any. Promise.\"\n\n\"Not those!\" he breathes through a sharp whisper-like burst of air. \"There are things, unseen things, happening all around us. Most go about their lives never noticing. Their ignorance protects them. Here, the curtain is drawn back just enough to peer inside. Here, fairytales don't end 'happily ever after.' Here--\"\n\n\"Ready for bed, Slugger?\" your dad says from the entryway, suddenly pulling you from Grandpa's story.\n\n\"Ready, Dad.\"\n\nYou feel Grandpa's eyes burning into your back as you leave, for the second time today.

Two twin beds take up most of the floor space, covered seemingly head to toe in stiff pillows, dressed in outdated pillow cases and covers. And yes, there's a homemade quilt on each bed. A fat TV sits in the corner. It's one of those that weigh about 300 lbs, despite its 24 inch screen, and has a VCR player built into it. Next to it, in a wicker basket, are old VHS tapes that are probably worth less than the plastic they're made of. Man, having no WiFi sucks. Sharing a room with your sister is a close second.\n\nEmma ignores you, intensely continuing her binge of New Girl as you throw several pillows to the ground making room for you on the bed. You shut off the lamp, bathing the room in darkness, save for the glow of the iPad. By the angle Emma watches the screen, she looks like she belongs in one of those old horror flicks. You know, the ones where someone tells a creepy story around the campfire, shining a flashlight underneath their chin for effect. Worst horror story ever. Who's that killer? Who's thaaat killer? It's Jess!\n\n---\n\nTotal darkness. You awaken in the middle of the night; the light from the iPad is off, signaling Emma's asleep. Soft breathing next to you solidifies that fact. The red glow of an alarm clock tells you it's 3:09. You roll over, attempting to get comfortable kicking another pillow to the ground in the process. As you settle in, a subtle wave of air passes over your neck, like a sigh, silent in the night. Instantly, alertness rushes over your body, but still, you remain unmoving.\n\nBesides Emma's breathing, it's quiet in the room. Like a predator stalking the jungle, your body is aware of every detail in the room, ready to burst into motion, senses at a heightened level elevated by an unexplainable knowledge of present danger.\n\nErrrrch!\n\nThe scratching sound from earlier rings into the blackness.

The footsteps are light and catlike, far from the heavy stomping you're accustomed to hearing from your parents.\n\nYou pause for a moment, unaware you've turned one ear towards the door as if it'll help you hear better.

A wave of bacon hits you, and voices from the kitchen area temporarily distract you from your current battle. Your stomach growls in response to the image of crispy strips of bacon, lined neatly in rows like soldiers standing at attention, their spaced shared with yellow clouds of fluffy scrambled eggs. Instead, you eat another pillow to the face.\n\nSomeone knocks at the door, and before you can say \u201cCome in!\u201d the door swings open. Typical parent move.

Leather straps are chained to each corner, along with what looks like a catcher\u2019s mask at the far end.\n\nAs you approach the table, one of the fluorescent bulbs overhead begins to flicker, creating a minor strobelight paired with the buzz of electricity. There\u2019s something familiar about this table. A feeling of Deja Vu runs through your body. A crash echoes throughout the room like a thick book falling to the floor, causing you to jump slightly. The beam of light pouring through the ladder, originating from the garage, is gone. Fucking sisters. Emma probably planned the whole thing. You turn--\n\n--the table calls to you. Its voice appears in your mind, like the way two lovers whisper into each other\u2019s ear. Compelled to feel its cold metal, to run your hands on the smooth chrome and smell the fresh leather straps, you approach the table once more. Your hand hovers over its shine, savoring the moment, giving your senses full consent to violate wet pleasure.\n\nYou place your palm on the table.\n\nscratch at the walls, grind their bones, scratch at the walls, grind their bones, scratch at\u2026\n\nImages flood into your mind, not only images, but someone infiltrating, occupying your mind space and filling it with their own.

Emma\u2019s face peers down at you, marked with worry.\n\n\u201cSorry. I must not have propped the door open all the way. Are you ok?\u201d she asks.\n\nScratch at the walls.\n\n\u201cYeah, there\u2019s nothing down here,\u201d you answer, gripping the base of the ladder. \u201cNothing exciting, anyway.\u201d\n\nGrind their bones.\n\n\u201cGet back up here, then.

Softly, Emma breathes on the bed next to yours. Tip toeing, you place your feet on the ground and silently exit the room.\n\nThe hallway is lit, dimly, from The Little Mermaid night light from the end of the hall. The light draws your attention, not just because it allows you to see. There\u2019s something comforting about it, mesmerizing, like the golden reflection of a chest of cold coins.\n\nTrancelike, you approach the light, squatting down to get a better view. Ariel, smiling brightly in her shelled bra, sits in front of the small light bulb, red hair flowing at her shoulders like a crashing wave.\n\nScratch at the walls.\n\nThe voice appears from Ariel.\n\nGrind their bones.\n\nYour face curls in confusion, hoping that you just imagined the voice. If indeed you\u2019re hearing a night light speak, something about it is very...unsettling, whether you imagined it or not.\n\nAre you a fucking man? I see how you look at me. Bet you\u2019d like for me to take off these shells, huh? Is that what you want? Would you make Ariel moan? Would you twist my tits and bite my neck? Come on, baby. Make it happen. Scratch at the walls. Grind their bones. You and I could have some fun together, the two of us.\n\nThe Little Mermaid continues smiling brightly, the voice subsided. Another urge fills your\nbones\nbody, compelling you down the hallway towards the back door. The door, once sticky and hard to open, slowly opens on its own, like a gentle breeze is softly guiding it. Ahead in the dark, your grandfather\u2019s shed looms, shadowy and inviting. You\u2019re urged forward.\n\nCool night air greets you as you make the walk towards the shed. The long, overgrown jungle-like grass blows in the wind, like anchored tumbleweeds forever in stagnation. Crunch, crunch, crunch, your footsteps ring in the night, sending loose bits of gravel grinding against one another.\n\nJust as the backdoor was open, so too is the shed. No light shines from within. Moonlight shines directly at the face of the shed. A single beam fires into the shed\u2019s interior, caused by the open door, a beacon for you.\n\nInside, you can barely see. Everything\u2019s dark with a hint of blue from the moonlight. The tool rack lies straight ahead. To the side, taking up most of the space, is the \u201873 Challenger Rallye. What a piece of shit. Just an old man holding onto the past by keeping that piece of junk around, the old man, the enemy.\n\nHe\u2019d beaten you once before. Damn him. Scratch at the walls. The \u201873 Rallye had no small part in it. The sight of the car sickens you, as if a testament to your failure. Susan, called Suzy as a child, was weak. Calling upon her traumatic past had been easy enough. Memories are suppressed easily enough, especially ones rather left forgotten. A grin appears at your lips as if your raffle ticket was just chosen. What are the fuckin\u2019 odds?\n\nLittle Suzy had quite the experience tucked away, deeply buried within her mind. If asked, she would deny and could so honestly. Not even she knew it happened, not until you made her remember. Oh, she remembered after that, couldn\u2019t stop remembering. Little Suzy, object of her father\u2019s affection. Boy ol\u2019 boy could that man show his affection. Dear little Suzy. Too cute for her own good. Why\u2019d she have to go and marry a stubborn mule like the old man? Doesn\u2019t matter, your failure would be avenged tonight.\n\nYour eyes find the old man\u2019s woodcutter\u2019s axe, leaning against a post. You lick your lips in anticipation. It\u2019s perfect. The lifetime tool of the old man would be his undoing. The axe, an extension of the old man, fitting, no -- molding to his palm, the object used for decades, his hands rough and calloused by the handle, to be used by you, here, tonight. How fuckin\u2019 poetic.\n\nIt does feel nice in your hands, the smooth wooden handle angled to help with swings, the head filed to a razor\u2019s edge. A little too big, perhaps, but you\u2019ll make it work.\n\nYou exit the shed, back into the moonlight. Gravel crunches underneath your steps, steps compelled in a robotic rhythm. The axehead drags on the ground behind you, creating a line in the gravel, tracing your journey back to the cottage. Once again, the back door lies open, inviting you in. Step right up!

Despite your worst nightmares, you\u2019ve never slid your hand into the cracked door, opening it just wide enough for your head to peer through. It was slightly ajar, but it might as well have been closed. Something about it felt intrusive, even if the opportunity was there for you. The door in front of you, now, is shut completely.\n\nFor the first time in your life, you open the door.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a scared kid walking into his parent\u2019s bedroom in the middle of the night, afraid, ashamed at himself for wetting the bed.

She always sleeps on the right side.\n\nInstead of a satisfying crunch, the axe buries itself in pure mattress, sending a chunk of padding into the air.

It pretends to be strong, sturdy, able to keep out intruders. Fucking pathetic. The old man is the exact same way. It\u2019d take two or three good swings to bring it down, to see what\u2019s inside. Same goes for the old man.\n\nAxe swings aren\u2019t necessary, though, the knob\u2019s unlocked. What\u2019s the point of closing a door, to keep outsiders as the name suggests, if you aren\u2019t going to lock it? Not that it\u2019d matter. A simple lock won\u2019t keep you barred from entry. It\u2019s just the thought that counts. Maybe the old man knew that and left it unlocked just to spite you. He\u2019ll pay for that.\n\nThe door creaks open slowly. It\u2019s not completely dark. An aged television, a fatty, probably pushing a 30 inch screen, is on, hung from the corner of the room opposite of the door.

My little Suzy. All grown up.\n\nFirst the old man. Then Suzy can have your full attention.\n\nYou walk bedside to where the old man, your grandfather, sleeps. His axe rests comfortably in your hand, the smooth handle a perfect size for his hands, his neck a similar size for the blade. The axe swings high, gathering momentum for the chop, like the top of a roller coaster before speeding down earthbound. Here it is. The moment you\u2019ve been waiting for since \u201873.\n\nThe axe swings down, piercing into the old man\u2019s neck, but then stops suddenly. Blood oozes out, not a lethal amount. Two weathered hands hold the axe handle, just above yours, preventing the axe head from burying further into his neck. He grunts, struggling to remove his lifelong tool from your grip. You lick your lips, grinning at his struggle.\n\nA flash of light bursts in your vision. The old man releases one hand from the axe handle in order to soften your chin with a calloused knuckle. Growling, you bare your teeth, no longer displaying your inner glee. No more games. He dies. You follow suit, releasing one hand from the axe to throw a punch, only you don\u2019t hit the old man. No, the knife edge of your hand lands on the back of the axe head, driving it deeper into the old man\u2019s neck. His eyes open wide as you send another blow to the axe, hammering the blade into his neck, further, like a nail digging into a stubborn wall, soft gurgles the result with each hammer.

She\u2019s younger, and wearing no makeup, but there\u2019s no mistaking that\u2019s Grandma. Standing over her head, a priest dressed in black holding a bible begins speaking in latin. As the woman seizes, arches her back, and claws out with her arms, the priest increases the volume of his voice.\n\nShe spits out, spewing incoherent words, the white of her eyes showing. Foam appears at the corners of her mouth, as she writhes, unable to move from the fastened prone position of the table. Her fingernails, long and animal-like scratch against the metal table.\n\nErrrrrrch!\n\nThe familiarity of the sound freezes you in place.

Both you and Emma are held in the arms of your parents, looking plump with baby fat. In each place where a smiling face should have been, scratch marks cover the picture like the inside of a cage once an animal breaks free.\n\nThe kitchen light flickers, and for a moment you see the dark bags appear underneath Grandma\u2019s eyes, drooping heavy like her face is struggling to maintain holding in place. When the light returns, she is gone.\n\nEmma screams, a shrill sound that looks to contribute to the shattered glass on the floor. Your dad takes her in his arms to comfort.

Look at you, frail, probably can\u2019t even get an erection. Do you want Suzy to try? Stick my hand down your pants and feel your manhood?\n\nSusan walks forward, her body shrinking with each step, her hair changing to blonde pigtails. Wrinkles in her face disappear, as if given a good ironing. In her smaller, childish frame, she steps out from your grandmother\u2019s clothes, leaving the apron hanging from her neck. The words have changed to A GRANDMOTHER LIVES ON KISSES.\n\nI\u2019ll do all the work for you. Don\u2019t you want to rip my apron off? There\u2019s nothing in the back.\n\nSuzy does a tiny twirl, letting the old man see her exposed backside.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d the old man answers. \u201cThis is wrong. I\u2019ll not let you use my Susan.\u201d He charges forward, axe overhead, ready to chop the thing down. Suzy scowls, her face briefly turning to it\u2019s wrinkled state, still attached to the child\u2019s body. She waves her arms as if throwing an imaginary ball from each hand, one after the other.\n\nTwo objects fly in the air towards the old man. With speed surprising for his age, two swings of the axe cut the forms mid-air. Like a stone in a river, the objects redirect around him, cut cleanly in half. Blood sprays in the air. The objects, now four, lie behind the old man, two pieces of his daughter-in-law, two pieces of his son\u2019s torso, both pairs of eyes frozen, horrified, mouth spread open in a fish-like manner.\n\nWith a yell, the old man charges forward, this time pulling the knife from his belt and throwing it at the thing. This is not a fight where he can afford to play on the outside. He needs to get in close, down in the trenches, gain victory through grittiness. Suzy ducks, reacting with otherworldly quickness. The knife plants itself behind her in the hallway wall.\n\n---\n\nThe only source of light, the guest bedroom, draws your attention. Your grandfather\u2019s voice and sounds of struggle cause you to hurry, not stopping at Father Mark\u2019s body to check on him. You already know there\u2019s nothing you can do for him. Maybe you can still do something for your grandfather.\n\nA whirl of air, and a knife plants itself in the hallway wall not ten feet from where you\u2019re standing.\n\nHeavy footsteps echo the cottage, the charge of your grandfather. You imitate, abandoning the slow, steady, silent approach. Axe in hand, you break into a run, the sound of your footsteps and elevated breath cutting through all other noise. It only takes a few steps to break into the guest bedroom. Light bursts into your eyes, bringing spots with each blink at the sudden change from the dark.\n\nYour grandfather\u2019s woodcutter\u2019s axe lies on the floor next to him, the girl from earlier, the one you saw with Father Mark, crouches over your grandfather\u2019s body wearing nothing but an apron, her bare backside exposed to you. This time, you do not freeze. Axe raised overhead, you charge, you rush to do what your grandfather failed to do.\n\nPain.\n\nBefore you can react, the girl picks your grandfather\u2019s axe from the floor, swiping it backwards. It\u2019s head buries itself in your chest, sending you sprawling next to your grandfather\u2019s body, stiff, the feeling of your limbs starting to subside like slowly dipping your arm in freezing cold water, starting with your fingers, then moving upward. The girl rises to peer at you, visibly confused at your entrance, like her father just explained the Tooth Fairy\u2019s secret. She bends down over your body, hands on her hips examining you, the loose apron at her neck falling just low enough to expose a pair of nipples on the verge of becoming womanlike.\n\nMovement suddenly explodes from your grandfather\u2019s body, his hand finding the hand axe brought by you. All it takes is one. An uppercut swing, one strengthened by years of work, decades spent chopping, sends Suzy\u2019s head flying across the room. Her head hits the wall, like a loose projectile in a pillow fight. Her body transitions back to its wrinkled, aged state, still in nothing but the apron.\n\nYou struggle to breathe. Each breath feels like it\u2019s pressing the axe further into your chest. Your limbs begin to shake, although you have not the control to stop them.\n\n\u201cYou were...supposed to leave,\u201d your grandfather manages to say, collapsing back to the floor.\n\u201cI...I..\u201d Words don\u2019t appear. Your mind is a flood of memories, the wave too much to organize a coherent sentence. Warmth suddenly grips your hand. The coldness rushing over your body stops as you focus on the source of heat. Your grandfather\u2019s hand grips yours. It\u2019s calloused, rough, comforting. He squeezes gently, reassuring you that everything will be alright. At this moment, it is, the love of your grandfather displayed in one tiny squeeze of the hand. His grip softens, becoming limp, losing strength. Soon after, your strength fades as well.", "action_results": []}]}]}, {"action": "Help Father Mark", "result": "Your grandmother, Suzy, the thing lands on top of Father Mark, raking his chest with claw-like hands. The Father utters a yell of surprise, which is quickly drowned out by the ravenous scratching at his chest.

Red pools begin to form on the floor beneath him, but he\u2019s definitely still alive. As you draw near, Suzy turns, her face curling into a smirk. She lets you tackle her. Your shoulder blasts into Suzy, blasting her from Father Mark\u2019s body.\n\nYou land on top of Suzy, her small frame fitting perfectly under yours. With a child-like grin, her eyes meet yours for a second, briefly exposing innocence. Quickly, they change, brewing, emanating something sinister. The grin returns to a smirk, like she knows a secret that you don\u2019t. Suddenly, her mouth bites at your exposed neck, tearing into your flesh.\n\nLike a vice, her jaws clamp down, holding firm despite your attempts to shake her off. Satisfied at the damage, she releases the bite, allowing spurts of blood to geyser from your neck. She flashes you a toothy, red smile, your blood dripping from her lips and cheeks like a child with a milk moustache.\n\nColdness sweeps over your body, your mind becoming faint from blood loss.

See you later,\u201d you politely say, hoping you never actually see him later. The man grunts, shrugs, and pulls a container of chewing tobacco from his back pocket, forgetting about you almost instantaneously.\n\nInside, you find Mom searching high and low for some good ranch dressing.

Well, they\u2019re old, just not old enough to...you know.\u201d\n\nYour mother answers. \u201cThey\u2019re spry, all right. The thing is, though, the body starts to shut down at their age.\u201d She pulls a jar from the aisle, eyeing it, reading the ingredients, then places it back.\n\n\u201cTheir generation had some nasty habits with diet and they smoked like a good salmon filet. And don\u2019t even get me started on their drinking habits -- different times, I guess. All that\u2019s to say, Grandma and Grandpa weren\u2019t very kind to their bodies, by no fault of their own.

Using the screen for light (the camera flash would be too bright), you exit the guest room to find the source of the sound.\n\nThe hallway is dark. On one end, opposite of your parents' room, the soft glow of a night light shines from a socket low to the floor. You creep towards the light, for one, you'd rather walk where you can see, and two, the footsteps sounded like they were running this way. You walk on the balls of your feet, crouched down slightly as to limit the sound of your steps. Part of you thinks if the earlier footsteps didn't wake anyone else up, then they definitely won't be woken by your normal steps. Still, you don't want to announce exactly where you are.\n\nAs you approach the tiny night light, you see the light is shining from a rushing wave of water, The Little Mermaid behind it holding a bright smile above her seashell bra.

It\u2019s a black and white photo of a younger version of Grandpa. He\u2019s standing next to a wide-looking tree stump, leaning a woodcutter\u2019s axe against his shoulder nonchalantly. Normal enough, except for his face. Brow furrowed, his gaze seems to be staring through the photo. At you. Corner of his lips slightly curled upward as if he knows something you don\u2019t.
