What I\u2019ve done so far is nothing compared to what I\u2019m gonna do!\u201d\n\nYou begin to do a series of tortures that would be too long to list here, but needless to say, he feels more pain than you do and definitely more than he could\u2019ve ever imagined.", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Do something else", "result": "You have a cunning plan!

She\u2019s wide awake though.\n\n\u201cCome on girlie, I got plans for you.\u201d You say and drag her downstairs and put her in the last chair. Due to all the movement and some slaps to the face, now ALL your patients are awake and rightfully afraid. You like that fear.\n\n\u201cWha\u2026? What are you going to do?\u201d one of the Mormons asks.\n\u201cSilence!\u201d you say and punch him in the face with some spiked knuckles, breaking some teeth and putting some gashes in his face. \u201cNow then, it is my sister and my anniversary today, and I want to do something special.

Damn, I forgot you won\u2019t be able to sing seeing as I cut your vocal cords\u2026alright fuck it, just mouth the words. Okay go!\u201d\n\nAll your patients are too frightened to do anything, they don\u2019t comply, well at least not until you slice off a nipple from Girlie!\n\n\u201cNOW FUCKING SING GODDAMMIT!

You look outside and see your sister drive up. You quickly get prepared.\n\n\u201cAlright shut the fuck up! Here she comes! Do exactly what I said and your death will be a lot quicker.

It\u2019s very easy! Now you try it!\u201d\n\nSis does so, and she doesn\u2019t quite kill her subject instantly on the first try, but that hardly matters, in fact you like it even more when sis slashes her throat again this time killing her.\n\u201cYay! I did it! Whoo, this is fun!\u201d she says as blood sprays on her.\n\nYou smile at this remark and you and sis take care of Stumpy and Voiceless in the same manner.
