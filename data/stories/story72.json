He's a fresh-faced teenager, eighteen or nineteen years old, and he's looking at you with this absolute shit-eating grin. You deign to give him a response. \n\n\n\"Since 1965. I was one of the first Marines to land on the beaches of Vietnam, at Da Nang.\"\n\n\n\"Holy shit!\" He bumps his friend with an elbow and points at you. \n\n\n\"Hey look, old Gramps has shown up here!\"\n\n\nYou grit your teeth against the sound of the whirring helicopter rotors, ten thousand feet up in the sky. The other troops in the helicopter talk among themselves, laughing and sharing profanities. Some of them jeer at you, a relic of the earlier stages of the war. They've just finished boot camp and are full of all that restless energy from getting plenty of sleep, exercise, and three hot meals a day. Hell, some of them bet that they could single-handily win the war now they're in 'Nam. \n\n\nYou turn your attention away from them and look down at the land below you. The vast, sprawling jungle stretches before you, it's green immensity blocking any view of what lurks underneath. It's a dark place, one of the last untamed areas of the world. However, you feel an unnatural bond to it. While other men have faltered and deserted, you've returned to it, to the crucible of this war, again and again. \n\n\nThe helicopter descends towards a small outpost, a \"firebase\" dotted with large 155mm howtizers. As the 'copter's landing gear touches the ground, the cannons unleash a devastating barrage, shaking everyone inside. One by one, the troops get out, covering their ears. You stuff the photo in your pack and prepare to do the same, but the pilot calls out to you. \n\n\n\"Hey Sergeant! Be careful, it's pretty bad out there, from what I hear.\"\n\n\n\"Alright, I got it. Thanks for the lift,\" you respond.\n\n\n\"Roger that.

Inside, a single ceiling fan provides the only relief against the heat, which is magnified by the army green walls. You are surprised to see someone you recognize among the rows of identical bunk beds. \n\n\nA powerfully built dark-skinned man scowls as he glances at his cards in an intense game of poker with a few other Marines. The pot seems to consist of pornographic photos and a generous amount of alcohol. Once he sees you, however, he drops his cards and grins. \n\n\n\"Johnny, what are you doing here!\" he yells, getting up and hugging you. \n\n\n\"Corporal Bronski,\" you say with a smile, \"I should be asking you the same.\" You are stifled by his monstrous embrace. No one calls you \"Johnny\" other than Bronski, and when someone does, they'll be counting their bruises the next day. \n\n\n\"Johnny, I thought you were on leave for at least another few weeks. Why are you back in the bush?\" he asks you.\n\n\n \"The moment I arrived at Okinawa, I got called back. Well, I thought, there goes my hopes of scoring with some of the Japanese girls!\"\n\n\nBronski lets out a deep belly laugh and bends down, clutching his knees. You smile politely as you wait for him to catch his breath. \n\n\n\"Oh, that makes sense. You see, the Gooks broke their own damned truce for the Tet holiday, and they're attacking us almost everywhere. Some of them even made it into the fucking U.S. embassy. We held them back though, and now we're gonna strike at them. I think you can ask the Lieutenant if you wanna find out more.\"\n\n\n\"Lieutenant?\" You look around the barracks and see only about twenty-five men total, counting you and Bronski. \"This is barely a squad, let along a platoon. What do we have a Lieutenant for?\"\n\n\n\"Well, most of 2nd platoon is either AWOL, in the hospital, or dead. We've been trying to get replacements, but without much luck. We've got you, which is good, but they also flew in the Lieutenant, fresh from the Naval Academy to command this 'platoon'.\"\n\n\nThe Marines at the poker table clamor for his attention. \"Hey, we gonna finish this game or what?\"\n\n\nBronski looks at them, then back at you with a smile. \"Why don't you join us for some poker, like back in the old days.\" \n\n\nWhen you were a lowly private, you and Bronski gambled and whored and drank. It passed the time and was hell of a lot of fun. However, you're now a Sergeant; you've got responsibilities to put in order. \n\n\n\"Bronski, we should probably first talk to the Lieutenant before do anything else.\" \n\n\n\"Come on, Johnny, just a round.

The men cheer as you take a seat at the poker table, and Bronski claps you on the back. You find yourself caught up in the game, so when you find you've run out of money, you're surprised to see that a few hours have passed.\n\n\n\"You gonna bet something, old man?\" The platoon machine gunner, Lance Corporal Simmons, grins at you with his heavily scarred face. Getting a face full of shrapnel from a mine earned him the nickname \"Capone,\" but his attempts to make you uncomfortable fail miserably. \n\n\nYou pull out your Polaroid photo of the woman leaning against the Mustang, and place it into the pot. \n\n\n\"Who's that?\" says PFC \"Doc\" Roe, who's really grating on you. The pampered college boy keeps spewing out how he's a conscentious objector. With his freckles and blue eyes, it's hard to take him seriously though. \n\n\nYou're a bit drunk and your lips are loose. \"She used to be my wife,\" you say, \"but I don't need to see her face anymore.\" \n\n\nBronski looks at you sympathetically, and clasps your shoulder with his hand. The veterans around you nod their head and keep quiet, not willing to press you for more information. A silent agreement among soldiers. However, the privates keep bitching about the sun, the food, and the local girls. Some things never change. \n\n\nDoc Roe goes on, \"Like I was saying, this war is injust. We shouldn't be going to foreign countries and bombing and killing people, while sending our own boys to die for nothing.\" \n\n\n\"Shut the hell up, will you! Pussies like you can't handle the Marines. I'd personally like to go out there and shoot me some commies,\" says Private Lering, his skinny frame betraying his boisterous ego. The two go back and forth, until you are ready to strangle them. However, someone in the room shouts. \n\n\n\"Atten-hut! Officer on deck!\" \n\n\nEveryone in the room immediately springs to their feet. The new Marines adopt a clumsy parade rest, but the vets don't bother. You get up and waver a little, unbalanced from the alcohol you've drunk. \n\n\nA young man, dressed in immaculately pressed fatigues and shined boots walks into the barracks. He stares at you with a cold grimace. Light reflects off his rank: a single gold bar, or \"butter-bar.\" He must be the Lieutenant. \n\n\n\"Sergeant, I've been waiting for you to report to me in my quarters, yet you failed to show. I come here and see you gambling while drunk and convorting with the other enlisted. You have failed to act as a responsible leader and broke several military regulations as well!\" \n\n\nAnger flares up inside you as the Lieutenant continues to rip into you. Who is this boy to insult you: a soldier who's a decade his elder with three years of combat experience? Your men hide looks of disgust as well. You're one of them, the Lieutenant is not. After the Lieutenant is done yelling at you, he moves on to Bronski, who seems to have broken rules since the moment he arrived here. \n\n\nThe Lieutenant finishes his tirade by saying \"you two are a disgrace to the entirety of non-commissioned officers in the United States Marine Corps. It is because of men like you that we are not winning this war!\" \n\n\nFuck that. The kid probably has never seen combat before in his life. You stay quiet though, and quickly sober up. \n\n\nThe Lieutenant sighs, sliding a piece of paper over to you. Orders. \n\n\n\"We are to participate in a helicopter assault at 0430 tomorrow. Get your men ready. I'll check in the equipment in four hours, there better not be a single defect.\" He spins around and marches away, his boots sounding against the hardwood floor.\n\n\nYou look at Bronski. \"He's quite the officer, ain't he?\" \n\n\nHe replies, \"Look, I'm sorry about the Lieutenant, but it isn't the first I got you in trouble with your superiors. Plus, he's like that to everyone.\" \n\n\nLaughing, you say, \"Ok, that's fair.\" \n\n\n You push away your feelings about the Lieutenant as you and Bronski get to work. You muster your half-drunk men and begin preparing equipment, but you are pissed when you find out many can't even disassemble an M-16 rifle. Bronski has the patience to help out, but you mostly yell and intimidate. Part of you is still mad from being scorned by the Lieutenant. \n\n\n\"What do you mean you can't clean your weapon? What are you gonna do when Charlie's on your ass and your rifle jams?\"\n\n\nLuckily, your hope is restored when you walk past Simmons. He sits in front of you with the various parts of his M-60 machine gun spread out and oiled in record time. \n\n\n\"Well Simmons, you've got here a pretty display, but can you use it?\"\n\n\n\"The Lord trains my hands for war, Sergeant.\" \n\n\nWell, at least there's one part of your platoon that not totally FUBAR. After somehow managing to pass the Lieutenant's inspection, your men go to bed. They seem jumpy, as for many of them it would be their first taste of the jungle. You can only hope it will not be their last.

C-Rations, ammunition, explosives... you doubt command can confidently resupply you. As they take off, a sense of dread comes over even optimistic men, crammed together in the helicopters. Several take out rosaries and start praying, while others take final glances at pictures of loved ones back home. Some close by glance at you for reassurance, but your grim face offers none. \n\n\nThe helicopter ride was smooth until the end, where you braved light anti-aircraft fire on landing. Small explosions of black smoke dot the sky as the helicopter descends. Your squad is unscathed, but another helicopter's rotor is hit by the flak. It trails black smoke as it swirls out of control, going down in a great fireball in the jungle. There's no time to mourn as rest of the helicopters land and men start getting out. Mortars go off in the landing zone, their deafening explosions halting your disembarking men in their tracks as they squirm for cover. \n\n\n\"Get moving! Get to the tree-line or we'll be sending you home in a plastic bag!\" you yell while dragging the less courageous soldiers out of cover. \n\n\n\"Shit Sarge, I don't wanna die here!\" one says, with tears dripping down his dirt-covered face. \n\n\n\"Then pick up your feet and keep moving!\" \n\n\nWith Bronski's help, you push them into the jungle. As the squad enters, the towering trees block the daylight and they are plunged into darkness. Suddenly, it falls silent. You feel swallowed up by the rainforest, as if it were a great beast that forced you into its giant maw. Counting your men, you are relieved none were hurt, aside from a few damaged egos. \n\n\n\"It didn't look like much from the air, but now the jungle makes me feel so... small,\" says Doc Roe, though he quickly draws the attention of a jeering Private Lering. \n\n\nAfter marching for a while, you receive orders over the radio for your first operation. A search-and-destroy mission, you have to relocate your men twenty miles to arrive at the objective. The Lieutenant navigates with a map and compass, confident that he is on track. You arrive at the bank of a small river, with no choice but to wade across. \n\n\n\"What the hell! You make us go through twenty miles of thick jungle, you give us mosquito repellant that doesn't even work, and now this?\" says Lering. You silence him with a glare. Leading the squad across the river, your men keep complaining about the conditions, the conscripts making the most noise. \n\n\nYou mutter to Bronski, \"And this is even before they get malaria and dystentry.\"\n\n\nOnce you get to the other side, you are covered in leeches. The city boys in your regiment start screeching at the sight of them, but Lance Corporal Simmons simply walks over and burns them off with a cigarette. You continue forward, water sloshing in your boots while your wet fatigues stick to your body- they'll never dry in a climate like this. \n\n\nThe Lieutenant splits the platoon into two, him leading one half and leaving you and Bronski with the other. His detachment is to attack an enemy village harboring guerillas, while your men entrench and cut off escape routes. Finding a nice vantage point, you keep your men in a small grove of trees, concealed by the underbrush. The Lieutenant's squad leaves you and your men behind. Anticipation quickly turns into boredom, as they say: ninety percent of war is waiting for the other ten percent. \n\n\nAfter a few hours, you hear something moving through the forest around a hundred yards to the west. You set your binoculars on them, but you can't see what's making the noise. \n\n\n\n\"Is that the Lieutenant and his men?\" whispers Bronski. \n\n\n\"I don't know,\" you reply. \"They went to the east, but they could've circled back here.\"\n\n\nYour men, readying their weapons, look at you expectantly. Fear and excitement can be seen in their eyes. \n\n\n\"What are your orders, Sergeant?\" one says. \n\n\nYou doubt that they're friendlies moving in the brush, but you can't be sure. However, you are set up in a perfect ambush position, and whatever's in there can't see you. With a single word, you can launch a heavy wave of automatic fire at the potential enemies. Your eager men await your command.

Keeping your focus at the possible enemy location, you call for the Simmons and the anti-tank team to ready their heavy weaponry. A few minutes pass, the air filled with tension as your men take aim. Then, out of the brush a few figures emerge. They are well camouflaged, leaves and branches covering their bodies. Viet Cong scouts, you think. They search the area, but can't discern your presence. They gesture behind them, and are followed by almost two dozen more men. They walk quietly out of cover, crouched to the ground. It is the perfect opportunity. \n\n\n\n\"Now!\" you yell. You and the rest of your squad opens fire. Most of your men fire their M-16s in automatic, spraying at the enemy. You know better though, and take accurate single shots. Simmons' machine gun cuts through the enemy, who fall like scythed wheat. The launcher roars and a high-explosive rocket impacts the center of the enemy column, sending dirt and body parts into the air. The Viet Cong are massacred before they even have a chance to fire back. The shooting ends as quickly as it had begun. In the silence, you hear moans of pain from the Viet Cong position, but your men did not receive a single casualty. \n\n\n\n\"What do we do with the survivors?\" asks Corporal Bronski. You flip over one who's still alive, checking for insignia, symbols of rank. Nothing. \n\n\n\"He doesn't have a uniform. These ones, we don't take prisoners,\" you reply with a grimace.

Confiding in Bronski, he assures you that they will found, eventually. As he says those words, a flare soars up the sky, basking the jungle with a blood-red light. \n\n\nBronski snorts. \"See, I told you.\" \n\n\nYou fail to see the humor of the situation. \"What is that kid doing! He's revealed his position to everyone in a ten-mile radius!\"\n\n\nThe squad marches over to a small clearing containing a single wizened tree, which is the center of a hastily built camp. Green tents flutter in the wind, barely held down by spokes, while the musty smell of gunpowder lingers in the air. By now, a thick fog has covered the jungle.They find their counterparts entrenched in the ground, along with a visibly shaken Lieutenant. They raise their rifles at the sight of you until you yell and reveal yourself. His eyes dart all over until he finds you, and he sighs with relief.\n\n\n\"Sergeant, thank god you're here! When the mist came, we heard sounds from all around the jungle. My men fired at them, but we hit nothing. I have no idea what they are!\" Well, at least he didn't friendly fire at you. \n\n\nHe starts rambling, \"We were supposed to attack a guerilla-controlled village, but I didn't find it. I checked my map, but I have no idea where we are! And my compass...\"\n\n\nHe takes it out. It's needle is erratically spinning, deciding on five different Norths in a few seconds. \n\n\n\"Sir, you have to calm down,\" you say authoritatively. \"These men's lives are in your hands. Once you panic, they will follow. We'll try the radio and contact friendly elements.\" \n\n\nYou walk over to Private Lering, who's skinny frame strains under the weight of his heavy backpack radio. He's in the process of bartering his chewing tobacco to a larger Marine so that he wouldn't have to carry it, but he quickly snaps to attention at the sight of you. \"You catch any signals on that radio?\"\n\n\n\"Sorry Sergeant. Nothing but static.\" You curse the obsolete radio your platoon has recieved. Reassuring the Lieutenant, you advise him to stay bunkered down here until dawn, which he agrees. You walk back to see your squad struggling to set up their own tents. Simmons smokes a cigarette, cradling his machine gun while laughing at the display. \n\n\n\"Good shooting out there, Simmons. I'd say that you were single-handily responsible for wiping out half of the VC.\" \n\n\nSimmons' smile fades. \"Well...thank you, Sergeant.\"\n\n\n\"Simmons, your shooting made it so not a single one of our men was hurt. You should be proud.\"\n\n\n\"I don't know, Sergeant. I keep thinking now, when this war is all done and over, how will I feel when I look back on what I've done? How am I going to tell my family what we did here?\" You don't answer back, but give him a reassuring pat on the back. You've been having these thoughts with increasing frequency, but they haven't been as distracting to you, as you have no more family to justify yourself to.\n\n\nA piercing scream drives you awake. Rifle fire erupts soon after, but as you poke your head out, you fail to see what is being fired at. You rush out with your M-16 towards the screaming, barely keeping your footing under the dim moonlight. \n\n\nYou arrive to find one of your Marines with a rusty metal object embed in his chest. His hands are wrapped tight around the wound, unable to stifle the blood, which flows in rivulets down his uniform. He looks at you with milky eyes, cloudy as the suffocating mist that surrounds you. He gasps for breath, pronouncing barely coherent words. You hesitate, not sure of the best course of action. You don't see the infiltrator who stabbed this man, but you know he must be close by.

You jump in shock and reach for a rifle, only to see Bronski attempting to calm you down. \n\n\n\"This is serious, then.\" You run back to camp, and see your men in a circle around the tree. Your eyes fall upon what they are looking at. \n\n\nSeveral of your men lie on the ground, twitching in pain. Their rolled-up sleeves reveal their veins, black as night, showing through their skin. Most are silent in their suffering, waving their heads and whispering words from feverish dreams. At the very least, they are stacked under the shade of the only tree in the clearing. \n\n\nAmong them is your platoon medic, PFC \"Doc\" Roe.

Some of our men report seeing bloody Viet Cong uniforms, even though you reported wiping them out yesterday. However, the worst happened after we drove them back, when the mist left.\" \n\n\nBronski explains, \"We all felt a chill after the mist left, and some even felt kind of sink. However, the men in front of you began showing symptoms. An unnatural darkening of the blood visible on the surface of the body. Their skin turning grey and peeling off. Pain and hallucinations. Medicine didn't work for them. Painkillers were ineffective and ran out fast.\" Bronski was studying nursing in college before enlisting in the Marines. What a waste, you think, but you're glad someone understand's what's going on. \n\n\nThe Lieutenant says, \"What's strange, though, is that only the men who you led in the ambush are sick.\"\n\n\n \"They probably had been weakened by malaria and dysentry, though,\" replies Bronski. \n\n\nA decision needs to be made. Your platoon has several \"wounded\" and one dead. They need medevac, but you're lost and the radio isn't working. The diseased members of your platoons thrash and spasm in pain, making it impossible to transport them in stretchers.

We stay here, we will be butchered. We have to get moving, and unfortunately those wounded must stay here until we find help.\" \n\n\nAfter inconclusive arguing, they turn to you to break the deadlock. Staying would be a noble choice, part of the Marine code. Yet, you know more men will die if you do. You see Lance Corporal Simmons trying to comfort Private Lering, while a grave is dug for the Marine who died last night. You look at your men, at the fear in their eyes.

He composes himself and straightens his uniform before talking. \n\n\n\"How about one last cigarette?\" he says, taking out a pack of Marlboros. \n\n\n\"I thought those ran out days ago!\" you laugh. You and Bronski smoke in peace, watching the sun slowly fall, painting hues of blue and red on the sky. \n\n\n\"You know Bronski, I've never thought I'd die like this. To me, death was always going to be a mine or a sniper, always something that would come out of nowhere.\" Bronski nods, giving his cigarette a long drag before puffing out smoke from his nose.\n\n\n\"Johnny, I feel the same. I've lived too long, and my time has come to join the ones who died long ago. I can only hope my family could make do without me.\" He says, trying to keep back the tears. You stamp your cigarette on the ground and pick up your rifle. The sun falls below the tree-line, once again revealing the sinister jungle. \n\n\n\"It's time for us to join our friends who died before us.\" He looks you in the eye and gives you one final handshake before moving to his flank of the barricade. You join your men, weapons readied at the surrounding jungle. The birds and the insects stop their chirping as the mist returns.\n\n\nDark shapes appear all around you, but you know better to shoot know, not wanting to waste ammunition. The first of the shadows appear, the mangled corpse of the Lieutenant. You put his hateful orange eyes in your sights and take him down with a single shot to the head. More figures emerge- the withered corpses of the dead members of the squad. They scream in familiar voices, but your men destroy them without hesitation. Then, mist thickens, and hundreds of shadows emerge. Some seem to be the dead bodies of Viet Cong, others wear what you guess to be French uniforms. In the middle of them, all stands the Green Beret, directing the corpses to attack. \n\n\n\"Fire at will!\" you yell, and your men put down a wave of bullets at the massive horde. Many of the figures are downed, but some jerk back when hit but keep moving forward. Your rifle runs out of ammo, so you pull your pistol and keep firing. The horde quickly closes in, as the gunfire falters. Ammo has run out. There's but yet one thing to do. \n\n\n\"Affix bayonets.\" There's a widespread clicking sound as your men attach their bayonets to the tips of their rifles. Their solemn faces look to you, and a sense of pride emerges within you. \n\n\n\"Charge!\" you yell, your rifle extended towards the horde. Your men yell out war cries and rush towards the enemy, their bayonets gleaming in the pale moonlight. The squad impacts into the front of the horde with such force that many of the shadows are knocked over. However, more move in to replace them, and brutal combat erupts. You stab your rifle bayonet into a battered French shadow, only for it to get stuck. Cursing you draw your machete and finish it off. Suddenly, a whoosh of air comes from behind and you instinctively dodge. You are now facing to face with the Green Beret. He wields a rusty bayonet, drawing your anger as you remember the young Marine he killed before. \n\n\n\"I won't let you go this time,\" you say. The Green Beret lunges towards you, but you dodge and trip him onto the ground. However, he grabs your ankle as well, making you plummet as his bayonet makes a gash in your leg. You ignore the pain and roll over, stabbing into the ground as he dodges. He tries to get back up, but you tackle him back down, slashing his throat with your machete. The Green Beret flails his arms, struggling to escape, but you won't let him. Finally, it's body disintegrates in the mist. You've done it. \n\n\nSeveral blades stab into your back, and you collapse. You watch your dwindling men fight against the overwhelming horde. Private Lering uses a wooden branch and clobbers several shadows before being cut down. Bronski has accumulated several slashes in his strategy to push down shadows and stomp them to dust. He too is stabbed in the back and falls. The sounds of fighting grow dim as darkness overtakes you. You smile at the thought of seeing your dead comrades once more. You'll have a lot of war stories to share.

It reminds me of an old bedtime story my grandma told me when I lived in the South - about Civil War soldiers.\"\n\n\nYou perk up, curious. Bronski has never talked about his childhood. \n\n\n\"What was the story about?\"\n\n\n\"Legend has it that there are patches of land in the South that saw vicious fighting- where men didn't shoot at each other in lines but fought and killed using hands, feet, and teeth. Sometimes, those places would be the graves of thousands of men. All that fighting and death would leave its mark, and the souls of the dead would stay there, fighting each other in an eternal battle. If you killed someone in a place like that, then the dead will rise and drag you into the ground with them, until you become one of them.\" \n\n\nYou laugh, \"That's a strange story to tell a child.\" \n\n\nBronski nods his head and smirks. \"I guess so. My grandma was a fine woman, but she was always a little off in the head.\"\n\n\nYou hope the same for yourself, that you're just crazy or delirious and imagined what you saw in the mist yesterday. But the accusations from your dead comrades, damning you to hell, still ring in your ears. You can still see their mangled bodies, their crooked gait as they reach for you. And their faces, orange eyes of utter hate staring into your soul. No, what you saw was real. Regret rolls over you, that your faulty order caused the death of your entire squad. You then realize something that makes you get up in shock, though pain shoots through your leg. \n\n\n\"Shit Bronski, what about the Lieutenant? Is his squad still alive? We have to find them!\" \n\n\nBronski calms you down and changes your bandages as your sudden movement caused your wound to bleed again. You need stitches, but Bronski's doesn't want your injury to be infected by shoddy needlework. \n\n\n\"You're right, we should look for him, but where? Johnny, our canteens are dry, and I'd hate to be stuck out in the jungle without water.\" \n\n\nYou'll return to the river you passed earlier, but that'll take time due to your bad leg.

You can only hope that his training at the Naval Academy will help him lead a group of frightened men- if they encountered the mist as well. Going to the river might also increase your chances of finding help. You're sure its the right choice. \n\n\nBronski fashions makeshift crutches for you before leaving. They're unwieldy and catch easily in the jungle underbrush, but at least Bronski won't have to babysit you on every step. Despite your situation, you're glad that at least you're here with Bronski. He's saved your life several times last night, so you hope you can repay the favor. \n\n\nSlowly but surely, you follow the squad's tracks from before and end up at the river. The flowing stream seems clean enough, but you pop some purification tablets into your canteen anyway. You and Bronski take a short nap near the river, before deciding on your next course of action. \n\n\n\"Johnny, maybe we should search along this river. We've lost our radioman, but we need to signal for help somehow.\" You look down at the long stretching river, which goes far into the distance. Certainly, if you travel along its banks long enough you'll find something or someone that could help you. However, you've lost an entire squad already.

It relaxes you and takes your mind off your worries and the impending dangers. As the sun sets, Bronski boils a stew to supplement your dwindling rations. As he takes a potful of water from the river, he stops, confused. \n\n\n\"What's the matter?\" you say. Bronski carefully reaches into the pot and takes out a wriggling black worm. It looks like a leech, but a closer examination reveals a small stinger coming out of its back. He tosses the leech back into the river. \n\n\nHe says, \"Well, I had several of these attached to me a few days ago as we waded through the river. I can only imagine what kind of nasty toxins it has inside that stinger.\" \n\n\nAfter dinner, you have the first watch. As the mist hasn't arrived yet, you start to doze off, until you realize something strange. The once flowing river is stagnant, and a quiet bubbling noise emanates from it. You point your flashlight at the river and see thousands of black leeches at the riverbank, slowly squirming out of the water towards you.\n\n\n\"Bronski, get up. We have to run!\"\n\n\nThe bubbling gets much louder as the river overflows its banks, sending the leeches towards you. \n\n\nBronski and you abandon your camp and try to get as deep into the jungle as you can, but the leeches are surprisingly fast, and you are slowed down by your leg injury and crutches. You feel a few stings as some of the leeches catch up with you. \n\n\n\"Leave me behind, Bronski!\" \n\n\nHe hesitates, not willing to let go of you, but you urge him away once more. The last thing you see before the black wave of leeches overtakes you is Bronski frantically running into the jungle. You hope he can find help and avoid your fate, as you are consumed by the jungle.

Too many have already died.\" \n\n\n\"Johnny, I know you feel guilty, but the best thing you could do for him is to find help!\" You shake your head, and Bronski sighs. \n\n\nYou search the general area, not finding much due to the nature of the jungle- footprints and broken twigs are quickly concealed by new growth. Yet, you notice a faint smell in one part of the jungle. A familiar smell, one recognized from prior experience traveling through devastated battlefields in the sweltering sun. It's the smell of death. \n\n\nBronski recognizes it as well, and you head in its direction. Eventually, you arrive at a clearing containing man-made defenses, like log walls, trenches, and sandbags. In the middle of the clearing stands a tree, where a pile of bodies is stacked against it. One of the bodies dangles from a rope around its neck. The flies covering the body fail to conceal the single gold bar on his lapel. It's the Lieutenant.\n\n\nBronski bends over and throws up. You control your gag reflex, as you've seen far worse than this. Other than the bodies, the clearing is abandoned. Looking around, you quickly deduce what occurred here.\n\n\nThe Lieutenant wasn't a popular man, given his insistence on following military regulation to the letter. Likely, he was killed by his men, once they grew dissatisfied with his leadership and especially since you and Bronski weren't there to stop them. Known as \"fragging\"(due to the use of grenades), you've never seen this happen in such a visceral way as hanging. Looking at the stacked up bodies, you realize why. \n\n\nA gruesome disease seems to have afflicted them. Their veins at the surface of the body are black, the skin slowly peeling off. Looking at the scratches on the tree and the dirt, you realize that those men had died thrashing around in pain. No wonder why the Lieutenant was killed by the platoon. They must have blamed the Lieutenant for the plight of the sick men. Afterward, without a proper leader they would scatter into the jungle, and who knows where they are now? \n\n\nBronski is still retching and sick, which surprises you. He's an experienced Marine and surely shouldn't be put off by a few bodies, though he may have been especially close to the dead men. Maybe there's something else bothering him. Suddenly, he runs into the jungle at full speed. You try to chase him, but you can't catch up by using your crutches. Your only friend has abandoned you in the jungle.

And now this jungle will do the same for you. \n\n\nUnconsciously, you wander around the mass graveyard of your platoon. Ignoring the bodies and the smell, you gather all the weapons and ammunition you could find. You end up with around six rifles, three pistols, as well as a machinegun and a rocket launcher with ammo to spare. You decide to find a nice vantage point and wait for night to fall. \n\n\nTonight, a blood-red moon is in the sky, its glare illuminating your surroundings. The mist rolls in, with the return of the voices of your squadmates accusing you of their death. Added to the cacophony is the Lieutenant's voice. You lie in wait as the first of your dead comrades walks into your sights.\n\n\nFiring the machine-gun, you cut it down, but the mist creature soaks up far more shots than a regular human would. More and more of your dead platoon members return, but your accurate gunfire stops them. Though they get up and reform after falling them, you fire the rocket launcher at the horde, which scatters and destroys them. The mist is unrelenting though, and soon dead Viet Cong bodies and what you can only assume to be dead French soldiers attack as well. You pull out your pistol and bayonet and fight them in close quarters. Just as you've run out of ammo, the field around you is covered with the bodies of dead soldiers. \n\n\nJust one remains. The Green Beret, walking towards you has a rusty bayonet of his own. He moves with surprising speed, lunging at you with his bayonet, but you dash to the slide and slash at his abdomen. Unfazed, he stabs at you thrice in quick succession, but you dodge one and let the other bounce off your flak jacket. You feint with your knife but then pistol-whip him in the face. As he's dazed, you follow up by plowing him onto the ground and slitting his throat. Exhausted and wounded, you collapse onto the ground. \n\n\nOne more figure walks up to you. You struggle to get up, but the whole night of fighting renders you unable. The figure walks closer. You're horrified to see Bronski, transformed like the rest of the dead. He stares at you with orange eyes, cold and inhuman. \n\n\n\"You were sick, weren't you? That's why you ran away from me, into the jungle. You were still trying to save me.\" You wait for a response, but he's silent. You open yourself up for attack, but he doesn't move. \n\n\n\"No Johnny, I can't kill you. The jungle has proved to be your true home. You may not be dead, but you are still one of us.\" \n\n\nBronski walks away, disappearing with the mist along with the bodies of the dead soldiers. You are left in the field, weapons and shell casings scattered all over. Slowly, you find the strength to get up and patch up your injuries. As you search the equipment the soldiers the left behind, you find an old backpack radio. You briefly consider calling for evacuation but decide against it. Bronski was right- you belong here.

Bronski is wary at your decision, given your current lack of water, but realizes that you truly feel responsible for the death of your men. He agrees to come with you, and fashions a makeshift pair of crutches to help you move better. \n\n\nThe crutches make you feel loud and clumsy, as they often snag on the jungle undergrowth, but at least Bronski doesn't have to help you with every step. You backtrack through the jungle, in hopes of finding the trail that the Lieutenant and his men left behind. Returning to the site of your squad's slaughter, you find something quite unnerving. \n\n\nThough none of your men's bodies are left, you find several Viet Cong soldiers dying on the ground. Their veins are black as night, their skin gray and peeling away. Thrashing in pain, when you approach them, they cry out to you in their foreign language. Though you don't understand what they are saying, it's clear what they want: end their suffering.\n\n\nYou raise your rifle, ready to oblige their final desire, but Bronski stops you. His face is pained, unlike his usually calm and optimistic demeanor. Your mouth gapes wide open as he pulls up his arm sleeve. His skin has turned gray as well, revealing black-blooded veins through his once dark skin. \n\n\n\"H-h-how?\" you stutter out. No, this can't be happening.

He's killed someone, and now he will be dragged to the grave himself. It's strangely comical as if Bronski's just joking around with you like he always does.  A hollow laugh comes out of you, followed by tears. You can't accept it- that your only friend will die a painful death, leaving you stranded in the jungle. No, you won't accept it.

If so, it would be the one good thing that has happened in this terrible goddamn war.\"\n\n\nNo time to waste, you begin to make plans. The Lieutenant is still out there somewhere, but he would have something that could help Bronski? No, you have to find something else, a high vantage point or a strong radio, which you can use to call for an evacuation. With your radioman dead, the latter would be much more difficult.

You begin marching through the treacherous jungle, pushing yourself to go fast despite your crutches. \n\n\nFor the next few days, you travel. At night, the mist returns, but you only see the Green Beret this time, staring at you from a distance. Bronski gets worse and worse until you are faster than him with your crutches. You encourage him the best you can, telling stories from your war experiences and reminding him to keep pushing forward, so that he may eventually see his family again.

You tie Bronski's ankles to your feet, allowing you to drag him forward while still using your crutches. He's a large man, and every step is difficult.

Your feel your Achilles tendon tear, but you ignore it. Keep going, keep going. Now you're at the edge of the large hill, the incline making it even more difficult to climb up. Keep going, keep going. One of your crutches snaps in the effort, almost causing you to slide off the hill, but you stabilize with your remaining crutch. Keep going, and keep going. The other crutch snaps as well, forcing you to crawl forward on your hands while pulling Bronski behind you. The sharp pebbles of the mountain tear into your palms, leaving a blood trail every few feet you go. Keep going. You arrive at the top as the sun begins to set. \n\n\n\"Yes! Yes! We did it Bronski!\" You've never seen a more beautiful sunset in your life. You start fumbling out some flares from your pack, lighting them on top of the hill. However, the red light allows you to notice something. Bronski is gone. \n\n\nNo, no, no, that can't be. You close your eyes and open them again. You don't see him. You drag yourself all around the hilltop, calling his name. You don't see him. You look at the rope coil at your feet, which was once tied around his legs. Now, it's tied around a pistol. Bronski's pistol. A Colt Model 1911, powerful and reliable like it's owner. \n\n\nYou scream your lungs out, releasing a war's worth of hidden pain, anger, and torment. Screaming until your voice gets hoarse, you collapse on the ground and gasp for breath. A great calm comes upon you, and the sounds of the jungle fade away.  You untie Bronski's pistol, which is covered in blood. You fervently try to wipe it away, but its no use. Well, that doesn't matter. You check to see if the pistol is loaded and close your eyes, pointing its barrel at your temple.\n\n\nThe mist gathers around you again, but you don't pay it any attention. Your fingers tighten around the trigger, slowly pulling it. Halfway through, you hear a soft voice... \n\n\n\"When Johnny comes marching home again,\n\n\nHurrah! Hurrah!\n\n\nWe'll give him a hearty welcome then\n\n\nHurrah!

Your index finger loosens around the trigger before you remove it entirely. You've made a promise with Bronski, and now you must keep it. You slowly stumble down the hill, while he keeps singing. \n\n\nThe old church bell will peal with joy\n\nHurrah! Hurrah!\n\nTo welcome home our darling boy,\n\nHurrah! Hurrah!\n\n\n\nYou are near the bottom, and you see a figure, with his back turned against you. Your hands shaking, you raise the pistol at it.

It stares at you, its cold orange eyes showing no emotion, showing no humanity. \n\n\nWe'll give the hero three times three,\n\nHurrah!

You walk up to the figure and empty your magazine into it. The body disintegrates, but the laughing continues inside your head. In an impulse, you turn the pistol on yourself, but there's no more ammo.

You arrive at a seemingly insignificant area in the deep jungle thick, surrounded by large trees and bushes. However, the smell of death lingers in the air. Searching the area, you find a wide tunnel into ground carefully concealed by a covering of woven branches and vines. You carefully enter with a flashlight, while Bronski covers you with a rifle. The tunnel slopes down around twenty feet, before opening up into a large room, supported by wooden beams.\n\n\nIn this room lies the bodies of the rest of the Viet Cong. They died fighting, evidenced by the scattered shell casings, bullet holes in the walls, and crazed looks on their dead faces. Slash marks cover their bodies, and the dirt floor is completely painted in blood. You step around carefully, noting the crates of extra food and ammunition stacked in the corner of the room. This was indeed their base camp, but something came inside and killed the rest of them. You can guess what that may be. \n\n\nCuriously, on one side of the room is a sturdy steel door, something you've never seen in a Viet Cong hideout. Approaching the door, you see it been heavily battered by the Viet Cong, as they tried to break through it to escape from their deaths. A combination lock on the door kept that from happening. \n\n\n\"Where do you think this leads, Bronski?\"\n\n\nHe smiles a little and takes out a small canvas bag with a shoulder strap. A satchel charge, it enough C-4 to blow down any obstacle. You exit out the tunnel and close your ears. Bronski pulls the pin and a loud explosion sounds out. The steel door has been blown out of its frame, but you're lucky it hasn't collapsed the underground camp as well. \n\n\nThe environment inside the door here has completely changed. Inside the door is a long corridor with concrete floors and walls. Light fixtures dot the ceiling, but those have gone dark. Midway, the corridor is intersected by another hallway going to the right. At the end of a corridor is another steel door, but with a symbol marked on it. \n\n\n\"Let's check that out,\" you whisper to Bronski.\n\n\nYou creep towards the door, trying to keep your step silent despite your crutches. However, when you come up to the hallway a knife twirls through the air towards you. You dodge, but it strikes Bronski in the arm, who drops his rifle which clatters onto the concrete floor.

Bronski had recovered and slammed it with the butt of his rifle. You take the opportunity to jam your bayonet into the Green Beret's eyes. He lets out a piercing animalistic shriek, flailing his arms in a struggle to get free. Finally, he stops moving, and with that, the body disintegrates into mist. \n\n\nYou turn around to thank Bronski for saving your life once more, but you're startled by his condition.

His eyes have started to display an orange tinge as well. \n\n\n\"Bronski, hold on, we're gonna get you out of here.\" He can barely move, so you drag him with one arm towards the door at the end of the corridor.

Oh well, the general wants to see you.\" \n\n\nDrowsiness overtakes you, and you fall unconscious as you are carried into a helicopter. You and Bronski's fate go into the hands of powers beyond your control. \n\n\n ", "action_results": []}]}, {"action": "Go for Bronski's rifle", "result": "You drop one of your crutches and lunge for Bronski's rifle on the ground. Once it's in your hands you turn around and fire a wild burst down the hallway at the Green Beret. However, you only manage to fire several shots before the M-16 jams, hitting the Green Beret a few times but not even managing to slow him down. You try drawing your sidearm but he with suprising speed, jumping on top of you and slashing your throat. \n\n\nYou choke on your own blood as you watch Bronski recover and try fighting back against the Green Beret. Bronski fires his pistol at it, but the Gren Beret grabs his arm and the shots go wild. He stabs Bronski in the chest and kicks him to the floor. The Green Beret moves over to you, staring at you with his emotionless orange eyes. \n\n\nYou die in a cold place, where no one will ever find you.

You ignore him and exit the barracks with Bronski. \n\n\n\"Interesting lot you've got, Bronski.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah Johnny, it's damn conscripts, you see. Bitching and moaning the moment they got here, and raising hell if I don't keep an eye on them 24/7. We almost had to court-martial a few for fighting before you got here.\"\n\n\nBronski follows along as you head towards the officer's quarters, the only air-conditioned space in the outpost. You exchange pleasantries on the way- he beams as he talks about the letters he's received from his wife and kids at home. You stay silent about your own family.\n\n\nBronski and you go way back, as you met him at boot camp. He's a fine soldier, though a bit of wild card. He was a Sergeant like you, but was busted down to Corporal for \"public drunkenness.\" Still, you're glad here's here with you. \n\n\nYou find the Lieutenant, a young man with a perfectly creased uniform and shined boots. He snaps off a crisp salute, which you return half-heartedly. Putting down his book of military regulations, he stands to adress you. \n\n\n\"I'm Lieutenant Stauffer and I'm pleased to meet you, Sergeant Smith. Thank you for reporting to me so promptly. I've reviewed your file before your arrival and I am honored to be working with such a decorated Marine,\" he says, though he glares at Corporal Bronski as he enters. \n\n\n\"A pleasure to meet you too, Lieutenant.\" You look at him, a little suspicious. \"Lieutenant, is this your first combat assignment?\"\n\n\n\"It is, but please don't be put off by that, Sir. I've received top marks at the Naval Academy and I'm eager to learn.\" He hands a sheet of paper to you. Orders.\n\n\n\"It's lucky you came on time, Sergeant. We have to prepare for a helicopter assault tomorrow at 0430. Get your men ready. I'll inspect their equipment in four hours.\" \n\n\nBronski and you return to the barracks, uneased at your Lieutenant's inexperience. You muster your half-drunk men and begin preparing equipment, but you are pissed when you find out many can't even disassemble an M-16 rifle. Luckily, your hope is restored when you walk past a Lance Corporal with a heavily scarred face. He sits in front of you with the various parts of his M-60 machine gun spread out and oiled in record time. \n\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\n\n\"Simmons, sir, but the boys around here call me Capone,\" he says, snorting. \n\n\n\"Well, you've got here a pretty display, but can you use it?\"\n\n\n\"The Lord trains my hands for war, Sergeant.\" \n\n\nWell, at least there's one part of your platoon that ain't totally FUBAR. After somehow managing to pass the Lieutenant's inspection, your men go to bed. They seem jumpy, as for many of them it would be their first taste of the jungle. You can only hope it won't be their last. ", "action_results": [null]}]}]}
