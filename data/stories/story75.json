Most would shiver in the freezing cold, but she does not. She got used to the cold long ago.\n\nSnowflakes fall and sit on top her head for a moment before melting. Thousands of tiny pins drop all around her. Each snowflake plays a note in this melody.\n\nShe sighs. Her wispy breath comes out like a fog before dissipating into the morning air. The graves say nothing to her. They\u2019re all dead, markers for dozens who should remain in the past. The woman trudges foreword crunching the snow beneath her boots with each step. She stops at a grave.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she mutters. She crosses her arms, folding into herself. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d\n\nThe grave says nothing. Even though the occupant lives on, she knows that life exists only metaphorically. She\u2019s talking to a grave. It does not hear her. It will not reply. Maybe this\u2019s just an excuse to talk to herself. She doesn\u2019t know for sure.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the last year? It\u2019s been three hundred and sixty-six days this time around. Zoe got to celebrate her birthday on the right day this time around. The poor kid\u2019ll have to wait another four years for that to happen. Oh, I almost forgot. She and Ezekiel insisted my cake have twenty-seven candles on it. Ain\u2019t that the sweetest thing?\u201d\n\nThe grey stone lies there as it always has and always will. The consistency warms the woman\u2019s heart. She raises her hand and looks at the lilacs she carried all this way.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you were into flowers. Well, this\u2019s a white lilac. I like the meaning of this little guy, so I grew it in my greenhouse just for this occasion. I\u2019d like the imagery more if you would take it from me, but you\u2019re dead. Not much you can do, so I\u2019ll just put it here.\u201d\n\nShe sets the flowers down. For a moment, her eyes flash red. She clutches her temple and blinks. They revert back to their normal brown.\n\nShe smiles. \u201cI\u2019m still in control.

You put in ten thankless hours making next to nothing. The wind blows through the holes in your jacket. One day, you\u2019ll patch it up. Shivering, you quicken your pace.\n\nThe path back is harder than the morning. You shrug. It\u2019s the price to pay for living up top of the hill. The mound has some sorta official name, but all in this sleepy little town just call it that. You like living there. No neighbors. No loud noises. No lights. Darkness. Just darkness and silence.\n\nYour feet hurt. Maybe the charity store has a better shoe size now. Looking down, you see two worn out tennis shoes that are a half a size too small. Each step shoots a minor jab starting from your feet and ending at your hips. You\u2019ll get to rests soon.\n\nSpying your house, a smile comes across your lips. The heater will warm your bones again this February night. You\u2019ll make something to satisfy your hunger. \u201cNo,\u201d you mutter under your huffing breath. \u201cPaycheck comes tomorrow.\u201d What do you have in the fridge and pantry? Four, maybe five slices of bread. There\u2019s some peanut butter too. That\u2019ll do. A feast for two.\n\nYou clench your fists. Why can\u2019t you do better? Is this all life will give to you? Damn life. Damn him. Your body shudders just thinking about that monster. You can make it on your own. You\u2019re good enough to do it.\n\nYour house sits in front of you. Each step causes it to look less and less small. You\u2019ve kept it looking nice. It could use some paint, and that railing needs fixing. The window still got that board over it. It could be worse\u2026 though it could be better as well.\n\nYou unlock the door and step inside. \u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d you say. No one replies, as always.

At the earliest, your kid arrives at evening. \u201cLazy and unappreciative.\u201d You lock the door behind you. \u201cShe could at least dust the place.\u201d\n\nYou turn on the heater and set about to cleaning. You\u2019ve been asking her for almost a week, but she won\u2019t get off her ass to do it. You feed her, clothe her, and give her shelter. It\u2019s all the minimum essentials, but that\u2019s all you got. Would expressing thanks be too much to ask?\n\nThe sun sets in the grey winter sky. Yellow lights pop up in the town below, signs of life. Humans are a funny bunch. By turning on lights, they fight back against the darkness, yet nothing really changes. It\u2019s like how you used to hide your face as a child. The big scary monster wouldn\u2019t hurt you if you hid your eyes. To them, the big scary monsters won\u2019t hurt them if they see all with their eyes. You chuckle. \u201cA different side to the same coin.\u201d\n\nOf course, the monster hurt you anyway, regardless of whether you saw it or not.\n\nYou look down. Your fists clench the dinner table, knuckles turning white from the grip. You let go. Grabbing an ax, you head outside to cut wood. Fires are cheaper to run than the heater. You found it\u2019s a good way to blow off steam anyway.\n\nYou aren\u2019t one of those muscled women. It\u2019s hard work, more hard work. Too bad your daughter\u2019s too young to help with this\u2026 You imagine the situation for a moment. It wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. Knowing her, someone would get hurt if she had to chop wood.\n\nAt least nature provides. If it wasn\u2019t for the several fallen trees on your land, then you\u2019d have to buy it. There\u2019s always a silver lining. The house sits around being a piece of shit, but at least the trees got some use. Well, they get squirrels too. Those chattering rats provide some cheap food too, just some time and a bullet.\n\nAs you pile up the wood in your wood shed, you hear a creak from the front porch, then another. Setting down the ax, you head back inside. She\u2019s home.\n\nThe girl carries her backpack and chatters her teeth together. She gives that blank stare you\u2019ve grown accustomed to over the past few years. Glancing at the clock, it shows a few minutes before nine.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re later than normal,\u201d you deadpan. \u201cAny explanation?\u201d\nShe shakes her head.\nYou clench your fists. \u201cI dusted the house. Any reason why you couldn\u2019t at least do that?\u201d\nShe shakes her head again.\n\nWell shit. Now, you\u2019re irked.\n\nYou unclench your hands. Your daughter flinches. You slap her. She stumbles back a step or two before a tear cascades down her face.

After a minute, adds hers, so you wash that one as well. She never helps with dishes. She slinks up to her room. If you allowed her, you\u2019d bet she close her door too.\n\nYou walk to an old dresser. Scratch marks, a few stains, and a large dent make it seem more like an antique than a newer commodity. You can\u2019t complain. It serves its purpose. Opening the middle drawer, you take out her report card. For the first time, you take out her paper from the envelope.\n\nD, D, D, F\u2026 Shit, that\u2019s fucking horrible. Why the hell hasn\u2019t she at least told you about this? For that matter, shouldn\u2019t one of the teachers tell you this instead of letting her education suffer. Glancing at the card again, you see one sliver of hope. An A sits at the bottom, too bad it\u2019s in art.\n\nYou stride up to her room. Your footsteps sound like marching drums. Your hands twist into claws again. Your eyes see in the dark as if it was light. You tongue grows long.\n\n\u201cExplain your grades.\u201d The sheer power of your words all but shake the walls.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d She moves from lying down on her bed to curling up into a ball.\n\u201cWhat was the rule?\u201d\n\u201cEverything has to be a C or higher.\u201d\n\u201cAre you a fucking dumbass?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Her words lack conviction.\n\nYou dash onto her bed. She gasps. Your face is inches from hers, so she closes her eyes.\n\n\u201cStop being lazy and actually try. I dare you to keep on doing whatever you\u2019re doing.\u201d\nShe shakes her head.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be real shit to pay if I see even a single D on the next report card. Got it?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nYou glance around the room. Her bed\u2019s unmade, her clothes are in piles on the floor, her desk doesn\u2019t have anything to do with schools. It\u2019s instead covered in drawings.\n\n\u201cAll you do is draw and wander the town. What the hell are you doing out there anyway?

Go to bed.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nYou leave as your body parts revert to normal and nod at yourself. That problem shouldn\u2019t cause you any more troubles now.

In the distance, you hear the slightest discrepancy among the snow falling. Two maybe three animals approach.\n\nYou doublecheck your position. Trees make visibility lower, but your position on top of a small hill helps that. The ridge is unfortunate because everything to your east, including those animals, can\u2019t be seen from your spot. If it wasn\u2019t for the two animal trails converging on this location, you wouldn\u2019t hunt here often.\n\nYou give a toothy grin. All sorts of sensations flow through your body. It has a name in some book, probably. You just call it the Hunter\u2019s High. Everything comes into greater focus. The moonlight becomes brighter. The smells become more potent. Even the snow seems to fall slower.\n\nIn most instances, you would strike, but their steps come closer and closer. You decide there are three different creatures.

Nothing makes you happier than a successful hunt. You provide for your little family and get to run wild.

Instead of taking the front door, you walk around to the back. You take some rope out from your shed and hang the deer for them to air out. As you hoist up your final kill, you notice a light coming from your daughter\u2019s bedroom. It must be in the early hours of the morning. What is she doing?\n\nYou creep to the back door and insert the key into the deadbolt. It clicks. You take careful steps inside, doing everything possible to not make a sound. Is she trying to waste electricity? She knows that stuff doesn\u2019t grow on trees.
