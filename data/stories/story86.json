And he volunteered to pay you fifty bucks to move around some boxes that probably aren't even heavy. You're actually a little surprised he called you, given how aloof he is about family. He'll chime in every couple years or so to meet back up with everyone, exchange gifts, and give that goofy smile that everyone finds endearing. Otherwise, it's radio silence. Paul is a good person, though, and his ailing health probably has something to do with the spotty record for attendance.\n\n\nYou grab a jacket, lock the door, and leave the apartment. You're not going to turn down a little cash in a world where rent goes up and pay stays flat. Paul won't need it much anyway, since he's going into retirement. You get in the vehicle, start the engine, and drive out of the outskirt suburbs, following rural roads to a turn. The car roves over grass and dirt, coming to a quick stop at an unassuming wood-beam house. There's a ladder propped against it, upon which a lanky figure stands, throwing powder on the roof that thwarts moss. He smiles at you, that same goofy smile, then finishes the chore before climbing down to say hi.\n\n\n\u201cIs that you, Stanley?\u201d He walks up to take better measure. \u201cIt's so good of you to come. I knew you would, for the money if nothing else!\u201d He gives a wry grin and chuckles you through the door. You tell him how you've been, and make small talk about the pumpkins outside. It's hard to think he'll have a lot of kids at the door on Halloween tonight, especially with everything boxed up against windows. Of course, with your insatiable sweet tooth and the candy he waves at you, that's not something you feel like pointing out. He scoots you through the house, past a room brimming with yarn \u2014 relics of his late wife \u2014 to a hallway claimed by heavy boxes of derelict hobbies. Everything from wood plane kits to soldering tools fills them, and you really wish he didn't have all these fleeting interests, since it would make the move a lot easier.\n\n\n\u201cWhy don't you sell some of this clutter? I know you don't need it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can't find a lot of time\u201d, he replies. \u201cI'm cataloging my sponge collection because I've got a pitch from a museum.\u201d", "action_results": [{"action": "\u201cSounds as interesting as waiting for toast, Paul.\u201d", "result": "\u201cWell it's not for everyone,\u201d he admonishes. He goes on to describe his collection and the museum offer, which seems like little more than an acquisition by some eccentric. \u201cI'm moving on to other collections,\u201d he says, \u201csponges are really getting too popular now.\u201d You don't ask more about it, but you're punished with additional details any time you stop moving.\n\n\nThe boxes in the hallway only serve to make the actual work harder. You've got three rooms overflowing with junk, which needs to be sorted, packed, and hoisted out of the way. Paul hovers around since he suddenly has nothing better to do, inventing all manner of new categories for these nick-knacks you couldn't possible surmise the need to keep. With all of his advice, the process goes well past the couple hours you were hoping for. You ask if you should come back another time, but he waves off the suggestion. He's engrossed in pouring over everything he forgot about, much to your dismay.\n\n\nHe turns the porch light off as the sky dims to night. Paul converts you into a candy funnel, fully exploiting the extent to which you like sugar. Eventually, you tell him you've had enough, and he says something about gaining weight if he were to eat all the candy.\n\n\nYou reach the third and last room, adorned with sets of bowling pins and an enormous collection of camping paraphernalia, among other things. You make some room on a relatively clean patch of letters for the first box when you see a curious pair of statues on a wall-mounted shelf. On the left is a knight in plate armor holding a longsword, tip down. Opposite of it is a hunched, faceless ghoul with balled fists and a flowing robe. They would've already been swept away, but the pewter statues both seem to have purple-tinted shadows. How is that possible? You reach to examine one of them.", "action_results": [{"action": "Move the knight", "result": "The knight stands prominently, a little larger than the ghoul, and it's closest to your hand. You pick it up; the room suddenly chills. Then, there is a coursing coldness in your body, without origin. It ends as quick as your next inhalation, and the air returns to a stable temperature. Your only guess is that you ate way too much candy. The statues are collected into a pile, along with other baubles, and you finish the job about an hour later.\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Stanley. You really saved me a lot of back pain. You've definitely earned the money,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\u201cSure thing, Paul. I'm going to take off. Let me know how the sponge sale goes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIn the dark at eleven? You're more than welcome to stay, really!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThanks for the offer, but I have other matters to attend to,\u201d you say.\n\n\nHe offers a meek shrug and a hearty wave goodbye. You get back in your car, happy to breathe in some dust-free air. It's an hour-long drive home, but it's Halloween, and you want to go somewhere. A headache starts at your temple. You decide you can figure it out on the way. You turn the key, shift the car into gear and merge onto the freeway. A half hour goes by; the headache stops. Despite the time and the hypnotically-spaced street lamps, you're wide awake. In fact, you've decided exactly where you want to go.", "action_results": [{"action": "Drive", "result": "You ride another ten minutes on the highway before taking an exit to a forest service road. Gravel kicks up from beneath the tires, rapping against the metal underside. Fifteen minutes in, you silence the motor and step out of the vehicle. A small picket at the head of the trail reads \"Sorry Falls 5.4 mi\" under the moonlight. The trail is a jagged path of dirt cutting through the dying underbrush, and carpeted in leaves. You begin trudging along, passing by barren trees. The air is frosty under the pellucid sky. Animal trails weave across both sides of the path \u2014 the wildlife still has a presence. You stop at a point where tree roots knot across the surface, around four miles in. You're getting closer, but you won't find her here.\n\n\nYou feel the pressure of a headache as Stanley's mind kicks with the realization of what's going on; that you have taken ahold of his body. It's a harmless protest. You look at the moon, the timeless observer, who watches from its remote perch in the sky. It saw the old men kill the witches. It witnessed the fading of magic from the world, long ago. But, here in this time, the soil yearns for the return of magic. You have tonight alone to find the crypt.\n\n\nAnimal paths run like scars through the brush.

The path turns, winding up to a lookout halfway down the falls. Water slips over the rim of the rock, separating into shallow rivulets, which divide further into beads before they hit the pool at the bottom. It looks vaguely like one of the waterfalls in your old memories. You jump blatantly off trail, running up the hill to your left that will take you around the falls. You should be able to ford them further upstream; it's not a deep river by any means. Half an hour later, you reach the other side. Your pants are soaked and your legs are stiff with the water's chill. You stop and dry yourself, pondering where you should be going from here. You're a little off course, so you'll need to run in the direction of the water for quite a while. That should take you down to the river, perpendicular to the falls, that it channels into.\n\n\nWith dry pants, you follow the stream downhill. The thickets pick up as you go, and you find yourself beating you way through them from time to time. Still, you push faithfully onwards through the undergrowth, reaching the river you recall. Something pushes at your mind. It's Stanley, inquiring about what's going on. He's given up on fighting, so there's no reason not to let him know what you're trying to accomplish.\n\n\nThere was a lady named Farra. She was one of the last true mystics that you know lived; she was one of the seers, fortune-makers and earth-brewers fatally punished for the crimes of witches. All practitioners were persecuted in the old days, undifferentiated. It's the cruel ones that are celebrated and remembered in the caricatures of Halloween decor tonight. The world is ready to see the light of the true mystics again, for the role of mankind in the play of worldly events is a lonely role indeed. Their heavy industrialization in the last few centuries marked a permanent departure from the old ways, and the seed must be resown before it's lost forever. These are not the instructions of a prophecy, you relay. They fall from a deep understanding of The Forms \u2014 the ways of nature itself.\n\n\nHe quiets down to consider the potency of those thoughts. You glance up and downstream, trying to recollect where you're supposed to go. Upstream seems the most likely. You walk along the stream for another hour, listening to the water playing at the edges of the bank, gurgling in eddies and slipping past itself in a muted rush. There is something eternally relaxing about such things. This is why the world must see the return of the mystics, and perhaps with them, the return of magic.\n\n\nStanley notices you've let your guard down.", "action_results": [{"action": "Fight for control over the body", "result": "A headache sharply forms as Stanley strains to repossess the body. Caught entirely by surprise, you can't pin his conscience in time...you're extracted, materializing as an ethereal wisp, circling madly. His mind is steeled to you, now. There will be no way in, so you rush off in the hopes of finding another vessel.\n\n\nYou're free of it, back in control of your own body. You test out your legs, blink and steal a few lungfuls of air. Your legs are throbbing with the shallow pain of oncoming soreness. You walk downstream for hours until you hear the dull roar of a highway, and continue onwards to it. You're close, but far too tired to make it all the way, so you pick a particularly comfy ditch and take a long nap. Still entirely yourself, you wake up, and spend the next half of the day navigating back to your car. You don't know exactly what to make of all this. The ghost certainly wanted full control over you for its incomprehensible quest; at the same time, you had an undeniable supernatural experience. How much of its rambling could be true? As you slot the key into the driver's side door, you can only imagine you'll be wearing a tin foil hat next year.", "action_results": []}, {"action": "Abide the possession", "result": "Stanley does nothing, and you don't notice.You reach a tight bend in the stream that sparks your memory. From here, Farra's grave must be a few hours to the left. You depart from the river banks, blazing directly into the forest. It isn't an easygoing hike, and it becomes clear that Stanley's body suffers from a lack of regular exercise. You find yourself breathing heavily, and often stopping to recover along the route. It's well after midnight, so you'll only have a few hours left. Stanley offers the thought of checking the phone for the current time. It's clear he's decided to accept your temporary inhabitance. You convey thanks. The phone indicates that you have about four hours to find the site. However, you're beginning to have problems doing so. Your memories are old, and few things remain in their places after a few centuries. Signs are scarce. You're forced to keep going until you, hopefully, run across a surviving landmark and get your bearings.\n\n\nMore hours of trudging through underbrush pass, and your body has switched over to a mixture of reserve energy and adrenaline. At this rate, you think, you'll be passing out just as the sun rises. Only minutes after that thought, you happen upon a clearing. Massive boulders lay strewn about, instantly matching memories; it would appear you're close. The grass grows unbridled here, with the longest blades threatening to reach your shoulders, and regular clusters up to knee height. Moonlight dapples the primal scene, and you can see short foliage in front of you, all beginning to curl at different points along their length, to differing degrees. You breathe in relief. Those are the ferns, the same ferns, that were here a millenium ago. You wade to them through the sea of grass, and the ground transitions to a mixture of trees, with ferns to fill the spaces between. You comb through them, searching for evidence of a grave.\n\n\nYou're leaning with fatigue by the time you find it, buried, hidden beneath the plants as though protected. Little round rocks, separated many feet apart by cycles of growth and decay, freeze and thaw. You remember these, taken from the forest around you 1,000 years ago, and stacked around the headstone that's no longer here. Probably for the best, you think, that there are no workings of man here at all.\n\n\nThe stones are gathered, gently, and arranged into three circles: one for The Observer, who hovers above even now; one for The Forms, which includes all aspects of nature; and one for The Provider, who will compete for the sky only hours from now. You build them around the ferns, and the work is done. There is no further reason to be here, and the end of the night marks your departure. You part from the body, flying in an astral path to the moon, who will shutter you to the Otherside. Stanley collapses to the ground from overwhelming weariness.\n\n\nSunlight wakes you around midday. You touch your head, blink, and shuffle around. He's gone, and you're back in control. You can't help but shiver as you recall last night. That possession shattered so many things you thought were true about the world. You look at the sky, and The Provider beams down at you.

A wintry gust riles branches into motion as the trail takes you on a curve over a steepening hill. You're forced to make switchbacks down to safely resume along the path below. Reaching the bottom of a small gully, you see a quiet stream. The animal trail ends at the river. Memories of how the land used to look come to you, and after a moment, you get your bearings. Her grave is upstream.\n\n\nShe was Farra, the last true mystic that you know lived; she was one of the seers, fortune-makers and earth-brewers fatally punished for the crimes of witches. All practitioners were persecuted in the old days, undifferentiated. It's the cruel ones that are celebrated and remembered in the caricatures of Halloween decor tonight.\n\n\nAlong the way, you see a black silhouette against the trees, opposite of the bank. It lumbers towards you as you walk upstream \u2014 a large bear. Your hands reach for imaginary weapons at your waist, but you're not in your own body, and Stanley has nothing convenient for defense.

Walking forward could be a threat. It's a gamble, but you'll take the safest bet possible. You start backing up and strafing to the tree line, ensuring your chest and eyes are always facing the bear. Your left foot lands on leaves, and you've made it to the trees. You probe blindly with your foot leading you uphill, watching all the while. Trees slowly begin to obscure your view, crowding in until there's no threat in sight. You sigh in relief. You'll have to give it a wide berth if you don't want to risk another encounter.\n\n\nAfter a good hour of flattening bramble, you get on a long groove heading in the same direction. The trek is difficult on the body, which you figure isn't conditioned for much more than walking around the house on a regular basis. You find the stream again, confident that the bear is long behind you. Walking the graveled shore, you try to remember where to go.\n\n\nThere should be ferns...ferns, curled on end, growing in irregular circles. Nearby would be a headstone, if human activity hasn't ground it to dust. There never was a body beneath that grave; it was built as a tribute from those that knew her. It's only by the moon's influence, or forces stirring beneath the sandcastles of man, that this whole area remains untouched by concrete and steel. The stream, which in your time was a river, must be followed for a few more hours.\n\n\nIt's not an easygoing hike. You stop to recover your breath at many points along the route. It's well after midnight, so you'll only have a few hours left. Stanley senses the question and, no longer fighting, pushes forth ideas about checking the phone. Either he gave up, he's biding time before the next tantrum, or he's accepted that you're in charge. The screen indicates that you have four hours to find the site. However, you're beginning to have problems doing so. The trees are different, right down to their species. Nothing matches up with your antique memories.

It looks like it might collide with your face.", "action_results": [{"action": "Duck", "result": "The owl is probably trying to ward you away, so you shield your face and duck.

It must be hunting mice.\n\n\nYou pause to take inventory of your location, but the survey yields nothing for memory. Farra's grave could be a couple hours in any orientation from here. You begin to probe in different directions, hoping to see something indicative, something to spark a memory. An hour passes, then hours, and you become desperate. You'll be too far away to reach the site in time if you don't pick an angle at random and hope to run across it. You pick an arbitrary direction and walk.\n\n\nThe leaves grow wildly here, in the rustic colors of Autumn, still attached to branches for the most part. Patches of moss cling around their limbs. The floor is composed of mostly bramble. Time slips ever forward, all without results.\n\n\nYou can feel the encroaching emptiness of oblivion. You look mournfully as daylight forms a thin line on the horizon. There is no suitable place to harbor until next Halloween. The moon beckons you to the Otherside, and so you make your final astral light, leaving business unfinished. Stanley collapses to the ground from overwhelming weariness.\n\n\nSunlight wakes you around midday. You touch your head, blink, and shuffle around. He's gone, and you're back in control. You think about last night with a shiver and a touch of sorrow. At first he seemed mad, but that faded over time. The possession shattered so many things you thought were true about the world; you can hardly imagine the ramifications of what would happen had he accomplished his goal. But instead, the world will remain bleak, without the touch of magic. If you can be controlled by a ghost, that lends some credit to its claims, and you're inclined to believe them.

Only some of them cast purple shadows...an offering for the possession, maybe? The ghosts left must be too afraid to leave their containers, for fear of being absorbed or exchanged as currency for the arrival of this being. You kick the pile away, and Greg's face twists with anger. He continues chanting.\n\n\nYou walk around him. He shifts in place to face you, but he has to lift himself only with his hands. It's easy enough to outpace his clumsy hand-turning. You circle around and catch him in the neck with the shiv, snapping through the vocal cord. He screams hoarsely and then goes quiet. Something arises from the body, juxtaposed between the house and its distant origin. It's stuck, halfway between the planes. You laugh \u2014 a mixture of spite and satisfaction. The red mist can only quiver in place. Greg's left hand goes limp, releasing a stone figurine with demonic features. It looks like it could've been the catalyst that started the whole thing.

A young girl answers the door; she must be around ten. You put your foot in the doorway and lean forward, touching the flashlight to her arm. She stands still for a moment, then closes the door.

You're standing alone in the house, with its bipolar arrangements and the cold draft coming in through the window. You snuff some of the candles still burning around the summoning circle. You collect them up to an unassuming dining room table, swiping off heaps of paper and clutter.

On the Indigo Plains sounds like a vision of the Otherside through the lens of a horror narrative. Inhaling Immortality comes across as someone's power trip fantasy; you know all too well the restrictions of ghosthood. You continue on through the mostly handwritten books, reading the chicken scratch edits in the page gutters. A Compilation on Ghost Theory seems to be little different than the baseless hypothesizing of other volumes. But, in frenetic, fine sharpie are little notes. A chill tingles your neck and spine. The notes and their descriptions...these were written by the mind of another ghost.\n\n\nYou lean in, scooting the candle closer, and take a deep read. Stanley is in there somewhere, exerting his maximum force to expell you. Your concentration is partitioned between the book and maintaining bodily dominance; time flows by. The portal between the mortal realm and the Otherside yawns open only once a year, on Halloween. When it closes, it brings finality to any ghost without a physical tether.\n\n\nYou glance out the defunct window.

After the first ten minutes, your mind departs from immediate concerns. Your thoughts start to linger on well-trodden grounds of uncertainty.

We're going to drive up to Hyacinth Beach because I heard about it in one of Greg's ravings. We'll be away from the sand, up higher and into hills where there's some old military bunker.

You stop to listen for signs of occupancy. Hearing nothing, the two of you walk purposefully down a hall, using phones for illumination. Kess immediately locates the anomaly in a gray, featureless crate of a room, with white scratchings on otherwise indistinguishable walls. Something black burbles, suspended, in the corner. It has a wispy outer atmosphere, always curling and reaching. The heart is an inscrutable black canvas, wider and taller than any person, roiling inwards. It really is a fragment of the Otherside.

It's interesting how much you appreciate downtime on the only eventful night since last year. The sky hovers above, the road sits below, and the whole world flits between.
