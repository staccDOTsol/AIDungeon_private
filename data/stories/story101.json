I have two parents who care deeply for me and a younger brother who annoys me. We live in a log cabin far outside the town of Lune, and the town is far away from the city. We work hard all day to tend our crops or rebuild our stuff, but it is a life I like. Each person in the town has something special about them. Hick can chop down trees faster than anybody. Martha can seduce any man, as long as they\u2019re unmarried. Old Man Roberts can read. I can tell some good stories.\n\n\nWell, they say I do at least. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that good in comparison to the story Old Man Roberts reads. He has a few books. They\u2019re about long forgotten tales of heroism and bravery. He wants everybody to call him Gramps. I do.\n\n\nRight now, my family is sitting around the fire. I\u2019ve wrapped myself with a blanket, but I\u2019m still cold. It\u2019s freezing outside. I don\u2019t like the cold or the snow.\n\n\nI lean up against my father. He\u2019s warmer than I. I say, \u201cWill it warm soon, Father?\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully not,\u201d he remarks, \u201cThe crazies have a better chance of freezing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill they ever come out here?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there food?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen they will as long as they\u2019re still breathing.\u201d I shudder.\n\n\nThe fire barely provides any light. The windows\u2019 curtains are drawn, and we don\u2019t have any candles lit. Shadows dance across the floors and walls. My memories of building our home are hazy. Everything seemed bigger back then. I was fascinated by the notches we had to make in order to fit together the logs. I was so excited to climb up the ladder and play in the upper loft. My brother and I still enjoy sleeping up there.\n\n\n\u201cYou two should go to bed,\u201d says my mother. She\u2019s the strict one.\n\n\u201cDo we gotta?\u201d asks my brother.\n\n\nMy parents do not answer his foolish remark. Instead, they stare at him with an emotionless gaze. He nods.\n\n\n\u201cGoodnight mother. Goodnight father,\u201d we say together. I hug my father; I hug my mother. Then, I scale our rickety wooden ladder up to the loft. The floor creaks after every footstep I take, but I do not fear. We built this house well.\n\n\nI lie down in bed and close my eyes tightly. I have the same problem that I always suffer from. My head does not wish to sleep.\n\n\nI think of men and women stalking in the night like wolves looking for a wounded deer. They are hungry. Some don\u2019t have a mind left while others do. The mindless ones are easy. My father learned to shoot bows from an Indian whose name was Joe. Joe still lives here, and he\u2019s the best bowman I\u2019ve ever seen. My father shoots an arrow through the heads of the mindless ones to put them out of their suffering.\n\n\nCan a person suffer without a mind? When it cracks, does everything become bliss? I really don\u2019t want to find that out for myself, but I imagine that they still feel something. Their flesh rots from their bones, but no bird or maggot eats the decay.\n\n\nIt\u2019s the ones with a mind that I fear. They\u2019re fine physically. They were mostly from the city. I don\u2019t know if anything is still there, but many men, women, and children fled. They got hungry. When people are hungry, they want to eat just as much as the mindless ones. Those people go all about looking for food, and the smart ones go out here. We are farmers, so we must have food. The problem is that there was a blight. We hardly have enough to survive. Some try to take it by force, but we and the town have killed many single people.\n\n\n\u201cRichard,\u201d says my mother, \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d He sounds so sad. He\u2019s always happy around me. \u201cWe should be able to make it through the winter. Then, we\u2019d plant our food. Lune will stick together like it always has. The crazies will die off from the cold and hunger. Things\u2019ll be hard. We\u2019ll make it though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're isolated, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re invisible. Dorothy was found dead this morning. A mindless crazy got her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHush, they still might-.\u201d His voice trails off into a whisper. They\u2019re still talking, but I cannot discern their voices any longer.\n\n\nI lie in bed and pray for sleep to take me. My arms and legs throb from my labors.

He outstretches his arms and basks in the amazing heat. He looks younger than my father. I suppose his parents are dead by now.\n\n\nMorty appears to be faring better than Jacob. His orange hair is not covered in ice now is his skin as pale. He\u2019s awfully thin.

Well, there once was a castle that sat on top of the hill. It is still there, and you can still stand under it in awe. It took the riches of one queen over her entire lifetime to build it. The finest craftsmen, the greatest masons, and the most gifted artists of the kingdom all converged into a single place for decades.\n\n\n\u201cIts walls were decorated on the outside with the white marble from the western mines. Its highest point almost could reach heaven. The drawbridge was made of the thickest cedar from the old Tyre kingdom to the South. That is just what the people outside could see. They were mostly stuck in city that surrounds the grand castle. Though, the city had running water and an underground sewer system that had never been seen before.\n\n\n\u201cInside the walls, oh, it is hard to describe. Silver ran through the seams of the stones. Tapestries detailing history and folklore drape from every wall. Those walls stretched higher than even the old churches. Their ceiling was curved, and I never learned of how they accomplished that. There were windows looking out that the visitor could use. They were very long and so thin. Each hall had doors which led to stables, great halls, servant\u2019s quarters, royal quarters\u2026 They even had a bakery. It was its own town.\n\n\n\u201cMy first memory was in the halls. I was lost and crying. I felt trapped, for nobody was around me. It was only me. I\u2019ve been told that a guard brought me back, but it was those walls that I remember. When I ran my hand across their magnificence, they felt cool. I would secretly lean against the walls during the summer. When I would pull my body off the walls, there was a small patch of sweat left behind.\n\n\n\u201cThe people were happy living under the rule of the queen. There were no wars, for there was peace with the surrounding lands. The navy was beyond compare that was docked in the port. In the morning, I stood in awe gazing at the sun as it rose through the sails.\n\n\n\u201cThe queen had two children. One was a boy, and the other was a girl. The girl stayed inside most of the hours, but the boy played outside. They were as loved as the queen, but the boy was adored by all. He took the name Daivat the Magnificent. He grew up in the ways of the warrior and the diplomat. His fame grew powerful as his body matured.\n\n\n\u201cOne fateful year, the queen became ill. She laid in bed for days with her daughter attending her every need. She died on a moonless night with her children around her.

They weren\u2019t supposed to be in groups.\n\n\n\u201cGirl,\u201d it growls. It is more animal than beast now. Why am I alive? My mother screams again.\n\n\nIt grabs my chin forcing me to look up.

Nothing is wrong. I am fishing. Fishing is so peaceful.\n\n\nMy line is being tugged at. I pull back on my rod. I see the line move back and forth in the water, so I jump to my feet. I raise my pole and snatch the fish before it could free itself.\n\n\nThe fish squirms in my hand. The slime is cool and sticky, so I set it onto the earth. It tries to flop to the life-giving water, but I smash its head in with a rock. It squirms no more. I toss it into a pile of other fish.\n\n\nIt is helpful that nobody comes out here. The skies are peaceful like the waters below. The only ripples of my world are the ones caused by me. Then again, there are countless other places to fish with bounty since this is my special place. Nobody comes into my special place.\n\n\nI shove my last piece of worm into the hook. The metal pierces through its intestines which pains the still living creature. Blood seeps out. It makes a plop when the hook and worm hit the water. I sit back on the ground and lean against the tree again.\n\n\nI yawn. The shade is relaxing. It\u2019s so hot, so any break from the heat is something I enjoy. My line is tugged at again. I stand while keeping the rod steady to not frighten the fish. I wait for another tug. I stare with all the focus that I can muster. It has to move soon.\n\n\nNothing happens. I pull out the line from the water and into my hand. I examine the worm. There\u2019s no evidence of any creature\u2019s bite marks though it is still pierced. I shake my head and lower the worm into the depths again.\n\n\nI close my eyes and wait for sleep\u2019s embrace.\n\n\nMy eyes open again, yet I do not know what waked me. I pull my hook out of the water and notice that the worm is gone. I set my pole down and pick up my net. I toss it into the pool of water. I pull out the few remaining fish. I carry the net over to the stream and release the fish back into their old home, for they deserve to make it back.\n\n\nI pick up my pole and the few fish I caught. Instead of walking home, I stare into the distance. The sun is touching the eastern mountains. Its red bleeds into the valley below filling the untouched lands with its rays. Birds chirp far above my head. I smile at their music, for it is an innocent song. I breathe in the fresh air and sigh.\n\n\nI walk back home on a game trail. My prints now cover what were once the tracks of animals. They don\u2019t use this one that often anymore, for they still fear mankind and rightfully so.\n\n\nI set my fish down inside my home.
